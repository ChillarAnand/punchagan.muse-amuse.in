StringIO in the cStringIO module in Python 2.7.2 doesn't handle
unicode strings properly.  This bug has bitten me on a couple of
occasions, in the recent past.
</p>

<p>
Just making a note for myself:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use StringIO if speed doesn't matter so much.
</li>
<li>Whenever possible, just convert the input to StringIO to a
string, if what you are doing doesn't really require unicode
strings.

<p>
Or may be it's just time to move up to Python 2.7.3

PyCon is back to Bangalore for the 4th edition.  I've been to all
the previous three editions, and I'm looking forward to this one.
</p>

<p>
I haven't spoken at any of the previous editions, and hadn't
even really considered speaking at the previous editions.
But, this time, I proposed a couple of talks, and both of them
have been accepted! Woot! Lots of work ahead of me, but I'm
really looking forward to give good talks.  I'll be talking
about Enaml, and showing a brief demo of all the wonderful
things it makes possible.  In the other talk, I'll give a
brief overview of the latest happenings in the SciPy community
and the projects to look forward to and contribute to.  Pankaj
and I will be talking together on this.
</p>


<p>
Also, Kenneth (lawgon) will be deeply missed at this edition
of PyCon.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, John Hunter, the lead author of matplotlib, also passed
away last week.  RIP. :(

Pankaj and I were stuck with this weird bug recently.  We had
a class <code>A</code> and a subclass <code>B</code> and an instance of B, b, was
returning False for <code>isinstance(b, A)</code>.
</p>

<p>
After some debugging, we found that it was a problem with
imports, and the same module was being imported twice, using
two different names – <code>bar</code> and <code>baz.bar</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here's a cooked-up example to demonstrate the "bug".  We
create a package baz, as shown below.
</p>


<pre class="example">
$ tree baz
baz
├── bar.py
├── foo.py
└── __init__.py
</pre>

<p>
We have our two classes, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> defined in the <code>bar</code>
module.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name">bar.py</label>
<pre class="src src-python">class A(object):
    pass

class B(A):
    pass
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We run <code>foo.py</code> and scratch our heads for a while, before
figuring out what's wrong…
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name">foo.py</label>
<pre class="src src-python"># We add the directory containing out package 'baz' to sys.path to be
# able to import using the package name.
import sys
sys.path.insert(1, '/tmp')

# We import A from bar module present in the same directory as foo
from bar import A
# We import B from bar, but refer to it, as a submodule of baz
from baz.bar import B

a = A()
b = B()

print "isinstance(b, A) --&gt;", isinstance(b, A)

for cls in (A, B):
    print "%s --&gt;" %cls, cls

for module in sys.modules:
    if 'bar' in module:
	print module, sys.modules[module]
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
isinstance(b, A) --&gt; False
&lt;class 'bar.A'&gt; --&gt; &lt;class 'bar.A'&gt;
&lt;class 'baz.bar.B'&gt; --&gt; &lt;class 'baz.bar.B'&gt;
baz.bar &lt;module 'baz.bar' from '/tmp/baz/bar.pyc'&gt;

Well, as you can see, I've changed my blog a bit.  I had been
trying to make it gel well with org-mode and looking for ways to
allow me to share arbit stuff with separate feeds for tags,
separate pages with independent feeds, etc.
</p>

<p>
I finally got around to tweaking the code of reprise to be able to
do this.  There are still a few things I would like to change, but
I'll make the changes gradually.  The looks are also straight from
uddigal's reprise, with a few tiny tweaks.  I hope it is alright
to be using it.  I really liked the theme.
</p>

<p>
Every tag now has a separate feed. <code>/tags/emacs.atom</code> will give
you the feed of <code>emacs</code> for instance. Also, I plan to have a
couple of more pages, one for all the interesting links I come
across and another for interesting quotes.  Both of these pages,
have their own feeds too (<code>quotes.atom</code> and <code>links.atom</code>).
</p>

<p>
In the spirit of minimalism, I got rid of comments.  I've been
looking for ways of having comments without all the javascript
cruft from disqus, but I didn't find any satisfactory way to do
this.  So, the site will have no comments.  You can write to me,
in case you've something to say to me.

<p>
Adios.

I gave a short talk titled, <i>Pictures, Songs and Python</i> in this
year's edition of SciPy India.  The talk was a beginner level
talk, mainly intended to get newbies excited about Python.  My
motive was to impress upon the audience that Python is a language
to help you think in. It's a good playing ground to experiment
with your ideas, quickly prototype ideas and have fun!  To my
surprise, the talk was liked by quite a few people.  Thanks to
Prof. Jayant Kirtane for the Bournville!

        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
This is some fun I had, trying to replicate what was written in
this post. I had been trying to understand what was happening
here, and found this post on Hacker News very helpful.
</p>

<p>
It is a known fact that our eyes have more cones for green and
red as compared to blue.  The Bayer filter used for digital camera
lenses is based upon this principle.  This post tries to
illustrate that using the following two arguments.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Looking at only the blue channel of an image looks very dark.
</li>
<li>Tripling the pixel size of blue channel doesn't cause much
distortion in the final image.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hence, our eyes suck at blue.
</p>

<p>
Their argument is flawed, but we could try and improve a few
things.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Looking at the blue channel.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This is definitely flawed, since the intensity of blue in the
image they have taken may be less and hence giving us a false
positive.
</p>

<p>
We could instead gray-scale the image and use these pixel values
in the 3 channels and look at the images.
</p>

<p>
This also eliminates the problem of the image being captured
through a Bayer filter.
</p>

<p>
Here's some <code>python</code> code to do the same. (uses <code>matplotlib</code>)
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">def show_channels(I):
    for i in range(3):
	J = zeros_like(I)
	J[:, :, i] = I[:, :, i]
	figure(i)
	imshow(J)

def show_grey_channels(I):
    K = average(I, axis=2)
    for i in range(3):
	J = zeros_like(I)
	J[:, :, i] = K
	figure(i+10)
	imshow(J)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Pixelating the blue channel</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Again, there was this argument of use of Bayer filter affecting
the image and the like.
</p>

<p>
What I did was to swap the channels, and then look at the
images. However I swapped the channels, the image where the
green channel was pixelated always looked the worst.  The
difference between blue and red was less noticeable, I feel.
</p>

<p>
Here's the code.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">def zoom(x, factor=2):
    rows, cols = x.shape
    row_stride, col_stride = x.strides
    view = np.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided(x,

			(row_stride, 0, col_stride, 0))
    return view.reshape((rows*factor, cols*factor))

def subsample(I):
    for i in range(3):
	J = I.copy()
	J[:, :, i] = zoom(I[::4, ::4, i], 4)
	figure(i)
	title("%s channel subsampled" %colors[i])
	imshow(J)

def swap_subsample(I, k=1):
    for c, color in enumerate(colors):
	print "%s &lt;-- %s" %(colors[c], colors[(c+k)%3])
    for i in range(3):
	J = zeros_like(I)
	for j in range(3):
	    J[:, :, j] = I[:, :, (j+k)%3]
	J[:, :, i] = zoom(I[::4, ::4, (i+k)%3], 4)

If you are new to <code>Python</code>, you should probably stop reading here.
But, if you have used <code>Python</code> and <code>numpy</code>, then read on. Before, that
try these bits of code.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">import numpy
a = numpy.array([1,2])
a = a + 0.5j
print a
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The "same thing", in a slightly different way.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">import numpy
a = numpy.array([1,2])
a += 0.5j
print a
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Both the code blocks, look really the same, until you look carefully.
Under normal circumstances <code>a = a + b</code> and <code>a += b</code> behave exactly
similarly, and we really don't need to bother about the differences
between them.
</p>

<p>
But, <code>+=</code>, which is an augmented assignment operator, actually tries
to perform the operation in-place, unlike the other statement where
<code>+</code> actually returns a new object which is again being referenced by
the name <code>a</code>.
</p>

<p>
But, when dealing with <code>numpy</code> arrays, this will lead to trouble.
When assigning to an array, it's <code>dtype</code> is not changed and hence the
trouble.
</p>

<p>
The right way to use the augmented assignment operator, would be:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">import numpy
a = numpy.array([1,2], dtype=complex)
a += 0.5j
print a
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The same thing is explained in this thread.  Also, Thanks to
Bhanukiran for asking me this.

Just back after attending PyCon India '10. It was not as exciting
as I hoped it would be.  That's generally the case with any
conference I attend.  (I guess, I expect too much from them. :P)
</p>

<p>
The keynote by David Goodger (pronounced like Badger :) was
"Good".  It was a very simple one talking of how to get Python
into the workplace.  His simple recommendation was to use Python
if we saw any opportunity where it could be used, without
bothering about permissions, convincing people etc.  "It's better
to ask for forgiveness, than for permission."  He spoke of myths
around Python – scripting language, dynamic language, too much
white space, toy language, nobody uses it.  He concluded the talk,
by saying mentioning Indian driving to be an indication of some
quick reflexes that we Indians have. ;) On the whole it was an
enlightening, humorous and enjoyable talk.
</p>

<p>
I didn't attend too many of other talks.  Amongst the ones that I
did attend, I particularly liked the one by Asim Mittal on using
the Nintendo Wii with Python.
</p>

<p>
On some thought about my experiences at conferences, I think
conferences shouldn't have any talks at all.  Or atleast, I
shouldn't be attending conferences for talks.  They are an excuse
to catch-up with people.  Conferences should have only lightning
talks of 10 mins and sprints.  Talks, with an extensive
explanation of stuff that can be easily found on the web, are a
waste of time.

Sage Days is a confluence of present and prospective SAGE Users and
Developers. It is an opportunity to come together to share ideas,
brainstorm and hack on Sage. Sage Days 25 is the 25th version of Sage
Days, and is being organized in Mumbai, India. In order to cater to an
Indian audience and scenario, this version has been tweaked
slightly. Sage Days 25 has beginner level tutorials, in addition to
the usual talks and sprints, to help new users get started with Sage
and help promote the use of Sage in India.

Sage is a free, open-source mathematics software system licensed under
the GPL. It combines the power of numerous existing open-source
packages into a common Python-based interface. It's mission is to
create a "viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple,
Mathematica and Matlab". Sage has tools for a broad range of
mathematical areas like Linear Algebra, Calculus, Symbolic Math,
Plotting, Rings &amp; Groups, Graph Theory, Number Theory and
Cryptography. Essentially, "it can do anything from mapping a
12-dimensional object to calculating rainfall patterns under global
warming" - as Science Daily puts it . Eager to get started? Start
here. Apart from being feature rich, it's usability is one of it's
greatest strengths. Sage Notebook, a web-interface for all the math
you'll ever want to do, is really the killer feature! As the Sage
Marketing page says, "The SAGE GUI surely works on your computer box,
because it just runs in Firefox!". Try it Now!

Sage Days 25 is being attended by the creator and lead developer of
Sage, Prof. William Stein. It will also be attended by other
developers of Sage. This would be a great opportunity to meet and
interact with them! The conference will be attended by a plethora of
enthusiastic people from all over the country who use Sage or are
interested in doing so. The conference will also see the presence of
many mathematicians interested in software. Who knows, you may run
into someone you'd want to collaborate with, for your future work!
This event will be a great learning experience, if you are even
remotely interested in math and software for it!

Shantanu and I conducted a workshop on Scipy at GNUnify '10. It
was intended to be an introduction to Scipy and Numpy through
Image processing. We expected an audience which was python
literate. But GNUnify's schedule wasn't too favorable for us. Ours
was the first talk scheduled and we ended up getting people who
only "heard" of Python, the language.
</p>

<p>
We had planned quite a bit of stuff expecting a python literate
audience. But unfortunately, we had to start almost from scratch
and couldn't do all of what we planned. Still, the workshop wasn't
too bad. Nobody left mid-way during the 2 hour workshop; nobody
was dozing either.  I would have liked my first talk at a FOSS
event to be better, though.

I'm now officially a part of the Arch Linux community! Arch Linux
is a lightweight and flexible Linux® distribution that tries to
Keep It Simple.
</p>

<p>
I have started using arch from less than a week or so. It took me
a while, not too long, to realize the beauty of this distro. I was
trying to tweak the settings of my org-mode's remember (on
Karmic), trying to make it work the way I liked it. After breaking
my head with .emacs and lisp for a while, I realized the version
of my org-mode was way different from the version of the docs, I
was reading. It didn't take long to figure out, which version of
org-mode to get. As a matter of curiosity, I checked AUR for the
version, and true to Arch's reputation it was bleeding edge! I was
still using Karmic, since I hadn't got my Arch installation
working the way I like it, yet. Out of laziness. sudo reboot; to
hell with laziness!
</p>

<p>
I was setting up things I regularly use, tweaking my way
around. After a day or so, I find python-numpy is out of date. And
to top it, an orphaned package! I didn't feel one bit good about
this. After some futile attempts to suppress my discomfort, I sat
down to work.
</p>

<p>
After an afternoon of effort, I created my first PKGBUILD. :) I
now have python-numpy installed using pacman! Pleasure to join the
Arch User Community! Also, thanks to lifeeth and Lynus Vaz, for
the sparks.
</p>

<p>
PS: I'm using Arch with Openbox. It's neat! PPS: org-mode is
really awesome! It's a world in itself. life in plain text,

others<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/a-byte-of-python.html#fn.3">3</a></sup>. This book has filled me with a sense of joy and

beautiful crowd. Further, it is a matter of pride, the book's been
authored by an Indian - its quite rare to find such books written
by people in this part of the world.

I have loved python, the moment I started using it. There are
quite a few occasions, where I did something, just because I had
the power of Python with me. Python is undoubtedly amongst the
best, not just as a first programming language, but to give the
user a sense of "do-able-ity" and I am thoroughly enjoying it.

Well, this isn't an update of how I'm doing on my sabbatical. Its
just been 3 days and I'm doing pretty fine.  I just finished
writing a script to keep my blogs page in sync with my
google-reader (well not exactly). The script parses an xml export
of my google-reader-subscriptions and updates the edits the html
of my unnought-blogs page. period.
</p>

<p>
There are a couple of things I don't like about this script.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, I don't want to keep exporting my
google-reader-subscription each time I make changes. The script
should be able to directly sync with my google-reader without me
having to export the file.  [I have read about the atom
subscriptions feed of Google Reader, but haven't been able to get
it right.] Hopefully, I'll be able to do it in the near future.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, The blog author's name is non-existent. I can't do
anything about this though.
</p>

<p>
Also, In the process, I had the chance to look a geeky ad. I found
it at the weirdest of places!

Summer'08! I'm at home, doing nothing practically. :| No
Internships, No Projects, No GRE plans (a little pushing for GRE
has just started from the junta around.)
</p>

<p>
Just to kill some time and to learn some Python, I have begun to
write an IRC chat bot &amp;lt;lafoobot&amp;gt; [Lafoot + Bot]. The present
haven of lafoobot is #fosskelog @ irc.freenode.net. Join in, if
you want to have a chat! ;) Lafoobot can presently do very few
things
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Yoyo", a newly joined user
</li>
<li>"Hello"/ "Yoyo", a user or pass on a Hello/Yoyo from user to
another.
</li>
<li>Gives Local time / GMT
</li>
<li>Gives a random word and its meaning [put in for the junta
preparing for GRE ;)]
</li>
<li>Gives out an MOTD or a fortune when it first joins \#fosskelog
</li>
<li>Googles a search term and returns the top 5 results (This is my
favourite feature and this is the reason partially for this
post. "!google lafoobot" doesn't return anything. Hopefully not
anymore.)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you have ideas for any other features or if you want to have a
look at the source, comment here or join #fosskelog. lafoobot's
code is licensed under GPLv2!
</p>

<p>
Other than this, the summer has been relatively uneventful but for
the two FOSS events I attended. Yes, two events, Sat and Sun, both
by Twincling (There are two different Twinclings! Don't ask me
why) Hoping to have some more action this summer!
</p>

<p>
PS: There's a Big discussion presently on whether lafoobot is a he
or a she. ;) What do you think?

I'll be on board the Amaravathi Express in less than three hours
from now! Bags packed, I'm waiting for the sun to rise, the World
to wake up.
</p>

<p>
I have set my self an objective of completing 40 problems from
Project Euler. I have done 39. [With exams going on I consider it
good progress] I will be attempting to push off the last one
before leaving. Here I come, Project Euler. Here I come,
Hyderabad!
