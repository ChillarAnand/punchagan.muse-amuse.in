Another post, with nothing concrete to say…
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>These are just a few random musings, for those curious about my
life and for the good health of my Blog which is so close to its
death..
</li>
<li>College (+ Hostel) is amongst few places, that everyone on
Earth(&amp; elsewhere) \*must\* get the chance to be in. There's a
whole new world out here, with hell a lotuva things you can do,
Here and Only Here… [I am not, by any means, talking of
acads!]
</li>
<li>Projects. Yes they are a part of almost all my random
stuff… cos I just Love them, when they are self-assigned and
off-hand. They get even more exciting, when the learning curve
is Steep!
</li>
<li>Deadlines can be wonderful things, if only I learn to respect
them.
</li>
<li>Lab-Tests, i guess, are amongst the most hyped tests in the
World! They aren't worth all that fuss.
</li>
<li>Grades ain't everything in Life. Not even if you are doing
Engineering!
</li>
<li>I live amidst /wonderful* singers, <b>marvelous</b> music composers,
<b>facile</b> lyric writers, <b>cool</b> Hackers, <b>amazing</b> photographers,
<b>inspiring</b> poets and what not. [Why the hell do people then,
look just for the *"industrious"/ grade scorers?]
</li>
<li>Music and Sleep are Great Healers. Laughter, too, is a close
competitor.
</li>
<li>GNU/Linux is addictive. More n more people getting addicted,
everyday!
</li>
<li>RHCE's got a pretty interesting test. Its rare to be interested
in undergoing the torture of a test, ain't it?
</li>
<li>Rules seem to be total crap, until you get the chance to look at
them from above.
</li>
<li>Quark'08 coming up! Gottu gear up for it!
</li>
<li>Comprees?? They don't bother me so much any more.
</li>
<li>Finally, for those who found all the above stuff boring and
dumb… here's some food for thought &gt; The Best things in Life
aren't Things…
</li>
</ul>

<b>Caution</b>: This post is just some arbit crap, that arose from some
 internal probing. Its utterly worthless for any reader other than
 myself. This could possibly even be classified narcissistic or
 whatever that's called.
</p>

<p>
Presently, I've got tests going on and they are half way
through. Considering this and the fact that its been over a month
since I last posted, writing a post now doesn't make much sense,
does it?[If my blog's been dormant so long, can't it be so for a
couple of days more?] But things I've been up to off-late, don't
make much sense. [in the past, at least they made sense to me if
not to others.] This post is just about that, going from being
senseless to at least being less sense [and hopefully, to being
sensible]
</p>

<p>
I've screwed up the tests so far, and don't think will be doing
much better in the others too. Even otherwise, I haven't done
anything good, anything that feels great, anything that feels
right, in the past couple of months (years?? decades??) [except
for one video with 'the gang', i didn't contribute much
though]. Let alone accomplishing something nice, I haven't even
been attempting anything decent enough. My priorities have gone
haywire, or may be not, may be I'm just doing things that are very
low on the scale or may be I'm not doing anything, things are just
hapenning.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I've slept through 'n' classes both inside and outside the
classroom
</li>
<li>I've stayed awake all night downloading some crap for my comp.
</li>
<li>I had been worrying about keeping my blog alive. Made numerous
attempts to post something, even if its no big deal not posting
regularly.
</li>
<li>Changed 4 different OSes in a couple of days!
</li>
<li>been ages since I last visited the Library.
</li>
<li>Slept through the morning lotsa times, even if I enjoy EBER-ing
</li>
<li>Bunked bathing just because i'll have more clothes to wash!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The list is pretty long. It ain't sensible to be putting down the
whole thing here.&lt;/ul&gt; I guess I've just been trying to escape
things. Running from doing important stuff. I've had enough. Its
high time I do something about it. I've decided to get in control
of my life, rather than being controlled by arbit stuff like
sleep, a blog, a grade, an addiction, a song, a cricket match, a
rain, a meal, a game of carrom, a prof's accent, a course, a test
or other such trivialities.
</p>

<p>
I wish to get back on track!!
</p>

<p>
..to get back into the habit of doing things I love, at the time
and place I like.
</p>

<p>
..to doing things that give me joy, in the true sense. Not
momentary, passing pleasures.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, with some effort, I will. (A nudge is all it takes.)
</p>

<p>
btw, if this post was a total bouncer, this is for you….

Exam time now. Sleep time cut-down! [already compensated for,
during the whole semester! :D] Getting up quite early during these
days…. [To cram in something at the last minute.. :P]
</p>

<p>
But all that kept aside, I feel great to be waking up early in the
morning. Watching the Sun rise.. is a great feeling. The calm of
the dawn, the chirping of the birds n the cool breeze.. Its
absolutely amazing – awe inspiring. Its a great experience. A
rare one for me,though.. :( For the last four semesters, I have
been a part of the owl-tribe… staying awake till late in the
night and doing all sorts of stuff… [other than study - during
the non-exam time…] Its great fun staying awake very late in the
night… having fun with friends… B'day parties, Musical
sessions in Ringo's room, Movies, Carrom-Nights, all-night
Chats(online n offline..) and lots of other stuff.
</p>

<p>
But all this can be done during the day can't it[The fun of doing
it in the night is totally different though..]?? If I enjoy the
morning times so much, shouldn't I be enjoying it more often? If
its such a great feeling.. to be waking up in the morning.. should
I trade it with all the fun I have, late in the night?? Is it
worth it? Like Voodoo believes, should I put in efforts to enjoy
the sunrise each day??  Is it time.. that I try out the
cliche… "Early to Bed, Early to Rise…" [EBER – that's what UC
calls it… and hence the title… :P]
</p>

<p>
<b>Update:</b> If for Fear, people are able to
cut-down so much on their sleep, and work so hard, I wonder how
much is possible for <b>LOVE</b>. I think this is the thing that drives
all the great achievers… the Scientists.. the Hackers.. the
Artists.. the Engineers… the Writers.. the Doctors.. and a lot
of others…  I need to find something, that I would Love to work
on.
