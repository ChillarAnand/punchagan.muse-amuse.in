<p>
I teach (Science and Engineering) students and teachers to use
Python for their computational tasks.  I'm occasionally asked
this question or something similar.  I remember, it was not too
long ago, that I asked this question very often.  I asked
anybody who was more experienced than me, "How do I start
contributing (code) to FOSS?" and all the answers I got, were
very similar.  Also, my answer is not going to be radically
different.  But, I would still like to answer this question,
because -
</p>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All the answers I got, were from big-time, experienced
contributors.  I suspect, they only vaguely remember how it feels
to be just starting off.  But, I am just starting off and I think
my answer brings a slightly different perspective that would help
others<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.1">1</a></sup>.

<li>This piece of writing is meant to be one comprehensive

this question in the future<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
</li>
<li>More than anything else, a reminder and reference for myself.  I
still have a long way to go.  I only have a handful of
contributions against my name (none of them earth shattering).  I
haven't (yet) done my 10,000 hours of programming nor have I
learned anything like half a dozen programming
languages.<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.3">3</a></sup>

I know how exciting the FOSS world seems, the first time we discover
it.  You are dying to contribute.  You want to contribute, Right
Now!  But you've no clue, what, where and how.  Relax.  Give
yourself time.  You've a lifetime ahead of you.  Explore.  Explore,
even more.  Play with things, Try out stuff, Break stuff, Spill
things all over the place.  Have fun!<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.4">4</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Given that you are reading this, I presume that, you do have access
to the Internet.  But, if you don't, it could turn an impediment to
your goal.  Easy access to a decent internet connection is a
prerequisite.
</p>

<p>
Learn a programming language, well<sup><a id="fnr.3.100" name="fnr.3.100" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.3">3</a></sup>.  By learning, I don't
mean getting familiar with the syntax or passing a bunch of exams.
Get familiar with the paradigms of the language.  Learn to think in
that language.  Write code that does something <b>real</b>, instead of
doing toy examples.<sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.5">5</a></sup>  Also, it helps know bits and pieces about the
history and evolution of the language.  This will give you a sense
of why some features are present (or absent) and will help you
program better, in that language<sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.6">6</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Some projects will definitely catch your eye, while you are
exploring.  Start using the ones that you need.  Follow them!
</p>

<p>
Start with using the bleeding edge <sup><a id="fnr.7" name="fnr.7" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.7">7</a></sup> software.  Bleeding edge
refers to the latest sources of the project, where the active
development is going on.  Given the continuous nature of software
development, using the latest source,
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>prevents you from wasting time on fixing bugs that have already
</li>
</ol>
<p>
been fixed and
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>lets you look at the latest changes being made and contribute
</li>
</ol>
<p>
effectively and easily
 Also, start following the project mailing lists – both the dev and
 the user lists, if they are separate.  The user-list discussions
 will help you discover functionality and possibly give you some
 chance to peek at the source code, too.  Don't be surprised or
 worried if you don't follow most of what goes on, in the dev-list.
 Be patient and keep at it.  You will learn a lot about the <i>what,
 why and how</i> of the project.  Also don't be afraid to look foolish
 there!  There wouldn't be one developer who doesn't have some
 embarrassing logs of stuff she said in public, in her initial days.
</p>

<p>
Slowly you'll start to learn the dynamics of the community – how
things function, the DOs and DON'Ts, etc <sup><a id="fnr.8" name="fnr.8" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.8">8</a></sup>.  Also, there's
a good chance that the project has an active IRC channel.  If it
does, hanging out there will give you more insights.  Contributing
to the documentation, is often a useful step before contributing
code.  Cleaning up the documentation or writing documentation, often
requires you to read the code and helps you understand it better.
</p>

<p>
Next, start <b>acting</b> on Bug reports (or tiny feature requests).
Start with trying to reproduce the bugs and sending confirmations.
Gradually, start looking at the source and trying to figure out
where the problem is.  Be patient, with this <sup><a id="fnr.9" name="fnr.9" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.9">9</a></sup> .  Once
you get comfortable with the code and the coding style, start
sending code snippets and comments, explaining what you think might
be the problem.  One fine day, you will be able to send a full
working patch!  But, before that don't hesitate to send partial
fixes.  You can learn a lot from the comments of the devs and
looking at how they finally fixed it.  Also, IRC could be a good
place to ask for help, if you are stuck and are looking for some
quick help, so you can move further.
</p>

<p>
In all of this, it helps if you have one (or a bunch of) favorite
<i>area(s)</i> or <i>module(s)</i> of the project, specially in a big project.
You should pounce upon any issues in your favorite area.
</p>

<p>
Participate in sprints.  It's not uncommon for projects to have
regular sprints.  Make it there <sup><a id="fnr.10" name="fnr.10" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.10">10</a></sup>!  Also, a couple of
developers may decide to meet up on a weekend and hack.  If it's
happening in your neighborhood, ask if you can join.  Don't be
surprised, if they shout out a big YES!  You will definitely learn a
lot, when there is help so close-by.
</p>

<p>
A <i>shortcut</i> would be to start your own project!  It is easier (in
some ways) to release your own code under a FOSS license, than
contribute to some of the existing projects.  You don't have to have
your code approved by the project leads, you don't need to mould
your code to fit the standards of the project, you don't have to
read and understand all the (relevant parts of the) existing code,
etc.  But all of this, definitely teaches you a lot.
</p>

<p>
As a beginner, I think it is important to solve your <b>own</b> problems,
problems that you care about (at least at that point in time).  Most
of the projects, started off with their developers wanting to solve
their own problems.  Only, incidentally, they solved some of the
World's problems, too!
</p>

<p>
Start small, though.  Don't start off with a project that aims to
replace Chrome or Firefox as the best browser, or an editor to
replace Vim or Emacs.  Writing extensions to your favorite software
could be a good place to start, for instance an Emacs minor/major
mode<sup><a id="fnr.11" name="fnr.11" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.11">11</a></sup>, a Chrome extension<sup><a id="fnr.12" name="fnr.12" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.12">12</a></sup>, etc.  Stand on the shoulders
of giants!
</p>

<p>
Also, take this as an opportunity to gain some of the skills that
would be useful, when you want to start contributing to others
projects.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Learn to use Version Control (Git + GitHub is awesome!)
</li>
<li>Learn to use build and setup tools.
</li>
<li>Learn about packaging and distributing your software.
</li>
<li>Learn how to license your code.
</li>
<li>Learn to Collaborate!
</li>
</ol>

<p>
All of this, I hope, would suffice to get your first contribution
in.  But, there are a few things that will help you in the long run.
</p>

<p>
Good English. Specially written communication, since that is how you
would be communicating, more often than not.  Fair or not, hackers
are known to be very particular about good communication.  I'm not
exaggerating when I say, what you say may be ignored even if it
makes perfect sense, if you said it in sloppy English.
</p>

<p>
Using a *nix would put you in some great company.  At the very
least, you save time when looking for solutions to known problems.
Using a good editor and learning to type quickly can be big
productivity gains.  You only get 24 hours a day!
</p>

<p>
An understanding of licensing issues, can come in handy, many a
times.

Happy Hacking!

I accidentally came across the blog-post Git-powered wikis
improved - GitHub. And this particular paragraph caught my
eye:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The new editor has the capability to support every markup
language that GitHub Wikis support. If you're a fan of Markdown,
Textile, pod or RDoc, the function bar buttons (e.g. bold,
italic, underline, etc.) will now work. We've even written brand
new inline help for many of GitHub Wiki's supported markup
languages.
</p>

<p>
The language definitions the editor uses are JSON-based and easy
to edit. If you'd like us to support a markup language that we
don't currently support, Gollum, GitHub's wiki software, is
entirely open source – fork our code and send us a pull request
with changes that support your choice language.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I sent a quick patch for org-mode in the function bar, and it has
been accepted.  :)

If not anything more, I hope, at least a couple of curious people
will explore org-mode and find it useful.
