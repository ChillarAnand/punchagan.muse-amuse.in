The ripples on the quiet lake,<br>
twinkling stars on a moonless night,<br>
and his lonely, crazy, thoughts,<br>
yet again, his faithful companions<br>
on another of those countless nights,<br>
searching for meaning, awaiting the dawn.<br>
<br>
the night crawled by, as he drifted afloat,<br>
memories of the past and dreams of the future,<br>
until approaching footsteps, brought him back<br>
did the chill of the wind, get to his head?<br>
or was his guarded secret, not his anymore?<br>
<br>
Before his thoughts, collect, he could,<br>
his friend, from far away lands unknown,<br>
was there with him, to share his thoughts,<br>
to hear the wind hum the tunes of yore,<br>
while the stars and the lake, as a duo, danced.<br>
<br>
They watch the sun rise, from atop the hillock,<br>
basking in the warmth, and see the town wake up,<br>
lose themselves in the woods below,<br>
on their way back, rest by the lake shore,<br>
watching it, silently, shine in the daylight,<br>
letting it wet their feet and clear his head.<br>
<br>
Together, they cook themselves, a delicious meal,<br>
n enjoy it, with some of the choicest old wine.<br>
Catch-up on things, and yearn for more, discuss<br>
all the many things, under the sun, and over,<br>
without a clue, as to how much time flew by.<br>
<br>
Riding away, as fast as they could, they reach,<br>
just in time, as the sun set, over the seas,<br>
perched on bicycles, in mirrored positions, with<br>
resonating thoughts, the horizon, they watch<br>
the sun set, the beach light up, and the fair begin.<br>
<br>
They ate and drank, sung and danced and<br>
just had a good time, for the rest of the night,<br>
indulging, in all that the fair could offer.<br>
the night was long, but if wouldn't go on forever,<br>
pretty well, they knew, they day was to end.<br>
<br>
the twinkling stars they watched, yet again,<br>
but to the sea's song, on the still warm sand<br>
slowly, but steadily, into sleep he drifted,<br>
only to be awake, moments later, with the<br>
bright sun coming harshly down upon him,<br>
lighting up the lake, like a carpet of jewels.<br>
<br>
all he had, once again, were just his thoughts,<br>
the lake, and not the sea, by his side,<br>
with fading impressions of an impossible dream<br>
after all, wasn't it just too much action,<br>
for just one day, for a life engulfed by ennui?<br>
<br>
One some day, he told himself, and walked away.<br>
