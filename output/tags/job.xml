This post is just to keep up a promise that I made to a friend of
mine (well, actually myself).  Presently, its the placement heat
in our campus and people are busy writing tests, waiting, giving
interviews and partying. This post doesn't have much to with all
that though.  In one of the interviews, I was called back and
asked about my Cleft Lip and Palate&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/the-third-round.html#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The interview panel had
concerns if I faced any serious medical problems due to this. I
explained to them everything that I knew about it and they were
convinced.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Later, I realized, I never explicitly did any reading on this
issue or asked my parents/others about this. I somehow knew about
it always. I probably learnt at all those visits to the dentist or
may be sub-consciously, when I was a baby. It isn't, though,
surprising to me that those guys had some reservations about
it. It's not everyday that you see a guy with a Cleft, though
statistics say there's prevalence of 1 in 500 births
world-wide. As a matter of fact, I myself haven't seen another guy
all my life (except for the pictures at my dentists') (also, they
weren't too wrong in suspecting other problems, though they had
absolutely no clue about this medical condition)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are wondering what the point of this post is, it's
nothing. It's just a pointer to those interested in reading
further on Cleft Lip and Palate.
&lt;/p&gt;
