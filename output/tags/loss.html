In memory of two gems, Koteshwar Rao Sir and Madhusudhan.
</p>

<p>
This, surely is a tremendous loss for the world, especially the
world of Math. I pray, from the bottom of my heart, May your Souls
rest in peace.
</p>

<p>
I got to know both of them at the same place, IIT Study Circle,
Hyderabad. Its not for long that I've been there and known them,
but both of them definitely have a special place in my heart.
</p>

<p>
Koti, as we lovingly called him, will always remain an inspiration
for me. ( and hundreds of others who've had the fortune to be his
students ) An Inspiration to thoroughly love and enjoy what I am
doing… to dedicate my life to something worthwhile… to be
uncompromising on the quality of work I do. Though I've failed
miserably in learning any amount of Math from him, I feel
privileged to have been his student.
</p>

<p>
and Madhusudhan was my bench-mate in there! I didn't speak much to
him there, [speaking to your neighbors was a sin at that place]
but I'll never forget the Ratna days; Sanskrit/English classes
once in a while, Chemistry Labs, Cycle rides/Walks back from
college along with Veeru and Srinu discussing everything under the
sun and the Krotov solving session in the park. Memories are all,
that remain…

I am back Home!! After one more ordinary semester, (academically,
otherwise quite a dramatic one actually) finally i'm back home! On
my way back home……
</p>

<p>
It was 3:30 am. After about half an hour's struggle to put myself
to sleep, I gave up. I don't know if it was the chill of the
night, the stink of the urinals or the shared berth that I slept
on, I couldn't sleep. I decided to get up and have a stroll
around. After some random walks, I sat down at the TTE's seat and
waited and waited and waited….
</p>

<p>
My last journey home, at the end of second sem was also quite
similar. I spent a lot of time at the TTE's seat…unable to
sleep… waiting, waiting and waiting.. but it was quite
different…. I was in the elite company of Hari (Hari Charan
a.k.a Prongs… his nick in CS)
</p>

<p>
That journey is still very fresh in my memory… I spent most of
it with him; The morning was busy and lively with DumbC's n stuff
like that. In the afternoon while the others were enjoying a good
nap, we tried studying some C programming. [ he just loved
programming and was excited about doing a lotta cool stuff during
the summer] But the afternoon heat got the better of me and
eventually i fell asleep…{I think, I induced a bit of sleep to
him too ;-) }
</p>

<p>
That night is a most unforgettable one… after all our guys went
to sleep, both of us decided to spend some time listening to songs
and try to put ourselves to sleep. [ The songs of RDB aren't
lullabies by any measure! and the train was running too fast: we
couldn't hear clearly with just one earphone each, even if we were
on the top berth]
</p>

<p>
So, we ended up discussing matters of common interest… we
chatted on topics ranging from Movies to Religion and Culture to
Dan Brown [he told me the whole story of Deception point in his
trademark style!] to Games and Programming. I spoke my heart
out… {and so did he; as he always did} [haven't had any other
discussion which comes close to it] After a couple of hours, we
decided to get down and move around, to enjoy the cool breeze, to
look at the villages and the fields going past… We shared the
seat of the TTE for about an hour [that was the only window where
we could sit : all the others had ppl sleeping beside them]
… looking out of the window… enjoying the breeze.. [and each
other's company : I thoroughly enjoyed his.. hope it was the same
with him too] and waiting, waiting and waiting…
</p>

<p>
We had already spent three nights waiting for him, but still
didn't lose hope. We hoped he would some how return or would be
found safe somewhere under the sun. But that was not to be. He
never returned… and all that was ever found was his body :
lifeless… The rough seas had him their victim… "There's no
more Hari Charan, ra!". Those were the words of nine.
</p>

<p>
Yes he is no more.Yet he is always here, immortal within our
hearts… his memories we cherish with pride… proud to have
known him and known by him… with awe and reverence we think of
him… we just love him! But I'll always miss that call of his,
"Chogni!"
