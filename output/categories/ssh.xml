A note to self, but may benefit someone facing a similar problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl class="org-dl"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt; &lt;b&gt;Problem&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;SSH-ing to our server was working well.  But, file
transfers like &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; were failing.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt; &lt;b&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;I had been thinking it was a problem with our
campus network on the first night and was too
sleepy to try and fix it.  But things didn't
improve even after one full day.  Then I asked a
friend of mine, and he confirmed that he has been
facing the same problem for a couple of days.  I
then tried file transfers to another server and
it was working fine.  Then I tried file transfers
between the two servers and even that worked fine!
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt; &lt;b&gt;Solution&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;After some googling, I figured that the problem
was with a machine between me and the server.
Changing the &lt;code&gt;mtu&lt;/code&gt; to 1492 from 1500 on the
server, fixed the problem. :)
&lt;/dd&gt;
