We, Ritesh and I, finished our first 100+km ride – approximately
110km. Yo!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;The Route map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
IIT-Bombay to Karnala Bird Sanctuary, and back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-1-1"&gt;Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-1-2"&gt;Down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;The Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We started at around 0720 and were hoping to reach Karnala Bird
Sanctuary by around 1130.  We — actually, soot covered clones of
us —  reached by about 1215 or so.  That's pretty decent,
considering we were directed to Karnala sports complex, when we were
looking for bird sanctuary and there was quite a bit of traffic near
Panvel.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While we were getting tickets to get into the sanctuary, a man was
amused by Ritesh's polka (dirt) dotted shirt and asks us whether we
rode down from JNPT.  We got all excited and told him, that we rode
down from Powai!  He just said, "Gone Mad!" and walked away, as if
madness was contagious.  Both of us, felt great!  We were high!  It
felt like the best compliment to get after a long, tiring,
(blackening) ride.  We got in and rushed to a tap and almost had a
bath under it.  The first touch of cold water was heaven!  Just a
while later, we got a shock.  We couldn't get any food near/inside
the sanctuary.  We will have to go back 3 km for that.  We spent
about an hour and a half, getting some oxygen, looking for a few
birds, giving up and settling with spiders and clicking some
pictures.  We got went back 3km to the hotel and spent about an hour
there (not all of it eating ;). We started back at around 1515.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The ride back was eventful.  We took a slightly different route,
tempted by a free Highway(NH4), waiting to be rode on.  The road
looked awesome, with a hill on the left, and no vehicles in sight.
But, as fate would have it, Ritesh's rear tyre gave way.  After some
search we found a guy fixing tyres of vehicles on the highway.  But
he refused to fix our bicycle.  He refused even to fill air in it,
so we could reach the nearest cycle repair shop.  After more search,
we found who agreed to fill air in the tyre. (It needs a special
valve pin.  The previous guy, probably didn't have it. But we
could've hacked up something.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We rushed to Kalamboli and got the tyre fixed.  Then we headed back
in the route that we had come on.  It'd been raining on and off
through out the morning.  But first rain on the return only started
near Nerul.  It was a great relief.  My cycle started moving more
smoothly…  I loved it.  We got lost a bit near Ghatkopar.  Also,
the traffic was quite bad there. (Why do drivers get so bad, once it
starts raining?  It's not unique to Mumbai, but quite visible here.
We were back in Campus by around 2040.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ritesh was energized after the puncture was fixed.  He rode like
crazy, after that.  The sole of my feet started hurting —
something like a cramp.  I don't know what exactly happened.  Also,
my groin was hurting quite a bit.  My only motivation at that point
was seeing Ritesh ride like crazy.  He was at his best, then!  I'm
still wondering where he got all that energy from.  It was a great
ride, for both of us!  Motivating each other to keep going. :)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ritesh, where to next?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;Some lessons for future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Cycle needs to be as close to perfect, as it possibly can be.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry your route map along. Enquiring the route a colossal waste
of time and sometimes unreliable, too.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pollution mask is a &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; for Mumbai (or any other city.)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry enough water and food. (We drank about 7L of water between us)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to learn how to fix punctures.  Need a tool kit.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A helmet, shorts with padding would be good.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An odometer would be useful too.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to use the hand-pump or carry along a normal pump.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should probably ride along with some Cycling group for the
experience of it. I'll get to learn a lot of things.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-4"&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Photos will come soon, hopefully.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;del&gt;I'd&lt;/del&gt; We had been on a 60 km long trip today. My second one, and
Ritesh's first. The map of our route is here. On the whole the ride
was wonderful! A thoroughly enjoyable one. It was near perfect, with
it raining only as much as we enjoyed an not anymore. :)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ride on Godbander Road was the most enjoyable part of the
ride. Simple Wonderful! That's what made the trip worth it!
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It was more relaxed than my previous ride and it took us about 5
hours on the whole. We must've been pedalling for about 4 hours. I
don't have the "actual" figures.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Except for the stretch of Western express highway (service road)
from Jogeshwari to a little after the Sanjay Gandhi National park's
entrance, the road was decent. The Eastern Express highway service
road was awesome!
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cycling alone is totally different from cycling with someone
else. We didn't really go together, but we were meeting up once in a
while. The loneliness, of rides on which you are alone, is
absent. But waiting for, or catching up with the other guy is a bit
tricky. I wonder how it would be with a bigger group.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I tried to keep going at about 60% effort and I still had quite a
bit of juice left in me, at the end of the ride.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;My cycle is definitely good! I really only understood this after
exchanging my cycle.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Exchanging cycles felt nice. A slightly different set of muscles
were in action. The newness kinda helped.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I should probably get myself a bigger round frame spectacles. Or I'm
craning my neck a bit too much, to keep looking ahead, while
pedaling. How about contacts?
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The problem with riding on the left of Highways is that you
"compete" with heavy vehicles. It sometimes gets a bit scary.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I should get a helmet soon.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I should get in touch with local cycling groups and tag along with
them on a couple of rides. I'll get to learn a lot of things.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ritesh took a few pics with his phone. &lt;del&gt;Photos in some later post or
with an update&lt;/del&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where to next? A ride inside the National park, probably or the
wonderful roads of Navi Mumbai.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Kudos Ritesh!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt; A few pictures, that Ritesh clicked on his phone. All the
photos were on the Godbander Road.
&lt;/p&gt;

A Rocking.. err.. Pebbling.. err.. Pedaling Trip. IIT Bombay,
Powai to the Gateway of India. I simply loved it!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The original plan was to land somewhere near Chowpatty beach, but
I had some useless landmarks and I got lost. I was not too
particular about going to a particular place, so didn't try too
hard to stay on track and was happy to end up at the
Gateway. Thanks to the Mumbai local, I don't know the road
routes. But, again thanks to the Mumbai local, I have a general
idea of the direction.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I woke up a bit later than scheduled, but almost made up for the
delay until I reach my cycle to find the rear tyre fully flat. I
quickly diagnosed the problem to be with the valve. But, I had no
spare valve, unless, I "borrow" it from a cycle near-by. I
replaced my valve with Vattam's cycle's and was good to go!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I didn't have a big enough water bottle, and carried along only
half a litre after drinking one half litre. The first half hour
was a breeze; possibly the best part of the whole ride. High on
energy and enthu. Then, my groin/ass started to hurt a bit. I
pulled out my music player to drown the pain in music. This kinda
worked and I pulled on pretty well until King's circle. That's
when I emptied all the water I had. I hoped to find water along
the way, if I badly needed it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sometime later, I had to take a right turn, but I never knew
where. I didn't bother to ask anyone, nor did I look at the
landmarks I had scribbled down. I was happy to go straight
ahead. :)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And by the time I reached CST/Fort, I did need water; badly
enough. I stopped at the next open shop (that was not a
pan-ki-dukaan) and got myself some Nimbu paani and a litre of
water (for future).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Gateway of India was just 10 minutes away from here.  Loitered
around there, for about 40 minutes. There were a lot of Policemen
all over the place. After about 5 minutes of me reaching there,
they cleared the whole area right next to the Gateway of India. I
don't know why. (Also, all along the way, there were a lot of men
in Khaaki. I guess there's some rally or some such thing
scheduled)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the return, I lost my way almost immediately after
starting. There was a one way road that I avoided and took the
adjacent road but ended up going off-track. I had some doubts
about this but they weren't confirmed until I reached Mahalaxmi
station! But there, a Taxi driver gave me rough guidelines to get
back on my track. I turned back and soon was "back-on-track".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'd planned to have breakfast at Idli house, as soon as I saw it
during my onward journey. So, I went directly to Idli house, and
treated myself to a Rava idli and some wonderful Kaapi. The waiter
got tipped well, too. ;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From Matunga, back to IIT was straight forward; except for the
growing traffic and the PITA (literally). The traffic signals were
a bit annoying, too.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the whole was an awesome trip! I loved it. Hope to go on more
such rides. But, I guess I'll head north-ward, the next time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
By the way, it was approx. 60kms on the whole and took me 5 hours
(including the time I spent at the Gateway of India) with about 3
hours 40 mins of pedaling.. err.. rocking. :D
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
