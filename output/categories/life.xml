The ripples on the quiet lake,&lt;br&gt;
twinkling stars on a moonless night,&lt;br&gt;
and his lonely, crazy, thoughts,&lt;br&gt;
yet again, his faithful companions&lt;br&gt;
on another of those countless nights,&lt;br&gt;
searching for meaning, awaiting the dawn.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the night crawled by, as he drifted afloat,&lt;br&gt;
memories of the past and dreams of the future,&lt;br&gt;
until approaching footsteps, brought him back&lt;br&gt;
did the chill of the wind, get to his head?&lt;br&gt;
or was his guarded secret, not his anymore?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Before his thoughts, collect, he could,&lt;br&gt;
his friend, from far away lands unknown,&lt;br&gt;
was there with him, to share his thoughts,&lt;br&gt;
to hear the wind hum the tunes of yore,&lt;br&gt;
while the stars and the lake, as a duo, danced.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They watch the sun rise, from atop the hillock,&lt;br&gt;
basking in the warmth, and see the town wake up,&lt;br&gt;
lose themselves in the woods below,&lt;br&gt;
on their way back, rest by the lake shore,&lt;br&gt;
watching it, silently, shine in the daylight,&lt;br&gt;
letting it wet their feet and clear his head.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Together, they cook themselves, a delicious meal,&lt;br&gt;
n enjoy it, with some of the choicest old wine.&lt;br&gt;
Catch-up on things, and yearn for more, discuss&lt;br&gt;
all the many things, under the sun, and over,&lt;br&gt;
without a clue, as to how much time flew by.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Riding away, as fast as they could, they reach,&lt;br&gt;
just in time, as the sun set, over the seas,&lt;br&gt;
perched on bicycles, in mirrored positions, with&lt;br&gt;
resonating thoughts, the horizon, they watch&lt;br&gt;
the sun set, the beach light up, and the fair begin.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They ate and drank, sung and danced and&lt;br&gt;
just had a good time, for the rest of the night,&lt;br&gt;
indulging, in all that the fair could offer.&lt;br&gt;
the night was long, but if wouldn't go on forever,&lt;br&gt;
pretty well, they knew, they day was to end.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the twinkling stars they watched, yet again,&lt;br&gt;
but to the sea's song, on the still warm sand&lt;br&gt;
slowly, but steadily, into sleep he drifted,&lt;br&gt;
only to be awake, moments later, with the&lt;br&gt;
bright sun coming harshly down upon him,&lt;br&gt;
lighting up the lake, like a carpet of jewels.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
all he had, once again, were just his thoughts,&lt;br&gt;
the lake, and not the sea, by his side,&lt;br&gt;
with fading impressions of an impossible dream&lt;br&gt;
after all, wasn't it just too much action,&lt;br&gt;
for just one day, for a life engulfed by ennui?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One some day, he told himself, and walked away.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

the time, together spent,&lt;br&gt;
the memories cherished,&lt;br&gt;
all the love, concern and care&lt;br&gt;
may they stay with us, for life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
as high and far as you like&lt;br&gt;
may you fly, like you own the sky&lt;br&gt;
while I fumble, with my flying guide&lt;br&gt;
I see the world, through your eyes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
may you run, with all your might&lt;br&gt;
as if, fighting for life, you are.&lt;br&gt;
struggling to walk, I stumble and fall,&lt;br&gt;
but get up each time, inspired to run.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
may you, in all that we shared&lt;br&gt;
find strength to go on, if en-route&lt;br&gt;
our paths diverged; you may have to wait,&lt;br&gt;
but you shall see me, on the other side!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to Chaitu, I re-read Love Unvoiced a few times and
realized, I was trying to say too much. Here's another poem,
with one part of what I wanted to say. I will not be writing
newer poems, to say the other stuff. Perform your own Fourier
analysis.

&lt;br&gt;
Hard, I tried, to stay mum,&lt;br&gt;
and keep it all within.&lt;br&gt;
But, not much longer can I stand,&lt;br&gt;
I give in, and here's my song&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
wherever you are, anywhere you go,&lt;br&gt;
whatever you do, or choose not to,&lt;br&gt;
whatever you think and however you feel,&lt;br&gt;
my love for you, it shall only grow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sweet, is the attachment,&lt;br&gt;
but let it not keep you from flying.&lt;br&gt;
the clear open sky, it's all yours&lt;br&gt;
fly! fly! fly!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
see all that you want to,&lt;br&gt;
and do all that you'd like to.&lt;br&gt;
to your hearts content, fly!&lt;br&gt;
without a care in the world, fly!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
for, if ever, you wish to rest,&lt;br&gt;
now you know, where to return&lt;br&gt;
right here, I shall be,&lt;br&gt;
with love, just a little more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Mute, I chose to be, but, boy!&lt;br&gt;
does it need to be told. All over me,&lt;br&gt;
it's written; and you, sure, read me!&lt;br&gt;
Love you, for being the more loving one!&lt;br&gt;

I'm not the body that dies&lt;br&gt;
on missing a beat or one breath.&lt;br&gt;
I'm not the mind, so fickle,&lt;br&gt;
I'm in heaven one moment, and next in hell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm the moments I live,&lt;br&gt;
not the ones, in which I just exist.&lt;br&gt;
I'm the dreams I dream,&lt;br&gt;
those fulfilled, and not just yet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am the occasions I grace&lt;br&gt;
and those, missed, where I am.&lt;br&gt;
I am the words I spoke,&lt;br&gt;
those I wrote, and those I will.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am all that I create,&lt;br&gt;
and the stuff that I catalyse.&lt;br&gt;
I am the love I receive,&lt;br&gt;
and all of it that I spread.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Don't cry, when I die,&lt;br&gt;
for I never really will.&lt;br&gt;

Come spring -&lt;br&gt;
a fresh lease of green&lt;br&gt;
drapes the bare branches.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The leaves, dancing and whistling&lt;br&gt;
to the tunes of the wind&lt;br&gt;
playing, screaming, and singing,&lt;br&gt;
in each other's company, enjoying.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Singing to one another&lt;br&gt;
promises of sticking together,&lt;br&gt;
come what may, through it all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The song goes on,&lt;br&gt;
but the count goes down,&lt;br&gt;
not noticed or just unacknowledged,&lt;br&gt;
first by one and then by many more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the song, still, goes on.&lt;br&gt;
And the promises too, of course.&lt;br&gt;
The song goes on and on and on.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Until silence falls upon, when all&lt;br&gt;
of them are gone. The tree, knowing well,&lt;br&gt;
watches on - it won't be long before&lt;br&gt;
a new bunch springs up to sing the song.&lt;br&gt;

Well, this could be called a post after ages, considering that
most of previous posts have just been 'news reports'. I have been
wanting to make a post since long, but I probably lost it. I
really am unable to write anything that I find worth posting [It
does raise questions about the existence of this blog. I'm writing
this, to answer that question to myself.]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This post is provoked by an act of sharing, an act of kindness, an
act of goodness, that surprised me. This post isn't about the act
itself, but it's about me being surprised. Why on earth should I
(or anybody) be surprised, when someone is just being human?
Aren't human beings meant to be and feel human?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wonder why people say, "this is a bad, bad world." I find a lot
of goodness and humanness around me. Unless I strain my memory
really hard, I can only recall people who try to be as good and
nice as they can be; People trying to be as human as
possible. Either there's something utterly wrong with my judgment
of people or there's something wrong with the general feeling that
the world is a bad, bad place.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There's one other possibility that just strikes me - I am so nice
to people that, everyone else tries to be nice with me. I don't
think I am such a big deviation from the average. I'm just another
goat, in the great herd.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And another one, I'm in a really special place, presently. I have
been only to the special places. I have visited only the places
that are at an extreme, far away from the 'average' place in the
world. But, given I'm just another goat in the great herd, this is
very unlikely. I am probably grazing at a random spot on the great
grasslands.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since these are ruled out, it boils down to either a wrong
judgment or a wrong general feeling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Coming to my judgment, I wouldn't call myself an Oracle or the
wise one, but I'm no dumb ass either. Well, taking the statistical
route, the number of times I've had any real "nasty" surprises in
dealing with people has been much lesser than the number of times
things turned out nearly as expected. My judgment could,
therefore, possibly given some credibility.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, that leaves me with just one possibility. The idea that the
world is a bad, bad place is not entirely true, if not completely
absurd and outright wrong. The world is really a nice place, with
"human" beings inhabiting it. The nasty surprises that you get,
really are the surprises and not the general rule.

Achieve something, I'm often reminded,&lt;br&gt;
achieve something, something that's worthwhile.&lt;br&gt;
Don't just kill time, they say,&lt;br&gt;
for, brutally, it shall kill you someday.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Make the best use of time, I tell myself,&lt;br&gt;
for I realize, how I spend my days&lt;br&gt;
is how I'm spending my life and&lt;br&gt;
I'm going to get just one of it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But, what is worthwhile, I wonder&lt;br&gt;
everything seems so good one moment&lt;br&gt;
and all meaning vanishes the very next.&lt;br&gt;
I'm utterly confused, somebody help!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Pick one from, spoke my brother,&lt;br&gt;
the 'everything' that seems good&lt;br&gt;
and do it right, just, do it right!&lt;br&gt;
Life, as you live through it, shall&lt;br&gt;
teach you to do things that are right&lt;br&gt;
and at the end of it all, you'll&lt;br&gt;
never regret what you've done&lt;br&gt;
but, only what you couldn't!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

dead and lifeless, in a box I lie&lt;br&gt;
just my size, to be buried deep somewhere,&lt;br&gt;
arranged with flowers, bright and fragrant&lt;br&gt;
more alive than dead, are they&lt;br&gt;
the final goodbye I have said,&lt;br&gt;
gone am I, never to return–but&lt;br&gt;
who am I, who am I, who am I?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
am I –&lt;br&gt;
the knowledge I arduously gained,&lt;br&gt;
from all the books I read and re-read.&lt;br&gt;
the wealth and riches I made,&lt;br&gt;
at the cost of sweat, often also blood.&lt;br&gt;
the skill with utmost care I groomed,&lt;br&gt;
for that, today, has me world-renowned.&lt;br&gt;
the numerous battles I braved,&lt;br&gt;
where win or loss never, only a fight mattered.&lt;br&gt;
all those dreams I dared to dream,&lt;br&gt;

None of it, I realised, am I,&lt;br&gt;

deep and loud, for one last time I wonder&lt;br&gt;
"the difference, you make to the world,&lt;br&gt;

Well, just another post to make it clear that
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm still alive
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven't forgotten that I have a blog
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven't forgotten my blog's password
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven't lost the ability to write arbit crap.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm not busy with anything interesting
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Keyboard works fine
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Arbit stuff going on around me off-late.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've had our official farewell; So we've officially bid goodbye
to B.I.T.S - Goa. People tried their best to make the occasion
appear "senti" but it seemed more like "psenti" for me.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wonder why our VC calls BITS as B.I.T.S; is it something
similar to people choosing to call SAP as S.A.P?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the advice given was of a copy-book style. But I liked
one of them, though it wasn't expressed well enough for me -
Learning from Books still remains an important way of learning,
even if work teaches you a LOT.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;College now has its own Debian Repository hosted on a server
running Hardy. Hats off to bad\&lt;sub&gt;sector&lt;/sub&gt; for showing the enthu to
get things done. The LUG here's got a great bunch of people
right now and its growing in leaps and bounds. I'm excited.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of my friends picked up Debian recently and apparently
both of them are loving it thoroughly. Linux, as addictive as
ever.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's been a while since I've been on the winning side in
carroms. Its so boring to be on the losing side for so long.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word is not a document exchange format&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/arbit-blab.html#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ; Use
html, plain text, pdf or the open document format.(if you are
not averse to openness) [I mention this &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; because I faced a
lot of trouble recently trying to handle some .doc files which
replaced the html pages that were being used on the PS site.]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So often, little things get blown out of proportion, so
quickly. Or its just that not everybody sees them as 'little'
things.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On slow connections, the download 'handler' of firefox does
really poorly. It's next to impossible to download anything over
half an MB.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This from the preface of SICP&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/arbit-blab.html#fn.2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ,a text book for an
introductory course on Computer Programming at MIT
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our design of this introductory computer-science subject
reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the
idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a
computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel
formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus,
programs must be written for people to read, and only
incidentally for machines to execute. Second, we believe that
the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this
level is not the syntax of particular programming-language
constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular
functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of
algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the
techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of
large software systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would like to see a few courses developed on similar lines here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gmail themes are good. I only tried the "Terminal" theme,
though. I loved it!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the very first time, I upgraded a distro. I successfully
moved to Intrepid from Hardy. (and that too with the campus
net!) This was before the repositories had been set-up. Now, it
should be a much simpler job to achieve the same
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just got the news of more Violence in Mumbai; What the hell do
these people want? I end this post here.
&lt;/li&gt;

This is a free world,&lt;br&gt;
you are free to will and whim,&lt;br&gt;
can it, at the cost of,&lt;br&gt;
your brother n his freedom,be?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Life is price'less',&lt;br&gt;
the big shots say, we realize.&lt;br&gt;
is it why, you sell ya brethren's life,&lt;br&gt;
cheaply, for personal gain?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The human'kind', we call ourselves,&lt;br&gt;
aren't the rivers, the air,&lt;br&gt;
the forests or our mother earth,&lt;br&gt;
worthy of our acts of kindness?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We are making rapid strides,&lt;br&gt;
from the micro to the nano,&lt;br&gt;
is it just in sci &amp;amp;amp; tech, or does&lt;br&gt;
it coop in our loves and lives too?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The world's a small place,&lt;br&gt;
the wise and learned say,&lt;br&gt;
is that why, not all have,&lt;br&gt;
a roof, under which to stay?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Its a world of press n media,&lt;br&gt;
is it why we are pressed at,&lt;br&gt;
with news that's dubious,&lt;br&gt;
in truth and worth as well?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We are all for world peace, they say,&lt;br&gt;
do you alone, make up "the world"? I ask&lt;br&gt;
How else would war, uncalled for&lt;br&gt;
bring about world peace?&lt;br&gt;
