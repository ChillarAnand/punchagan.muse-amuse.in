If you are new to &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;, you should probably stop reading here.
But, if you have used &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt;, then read on. Before, that
try these bits of code.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;

&lt;pre class="src src-python"&gt;import numpy
a = numpy.array([1,2])
a = a + 0.5j
print a
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The "same thing", in a slightly different way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;

&lt;pre class="src src-python"&gt;import numpy
a = numpy.array([1,2])
a += 0.5j
print a
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Both the code blocks, look really the same, until you look carefully.
Under normal circumstances &lt;code&gt;a = a + b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a += b&lt;/code&gt; behave exactly
similarly, and we really don't need to bother about the differences
between them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt;, which is an augmented assignment operator, actually tries
to perform the operation in-place, unlike the other statement where
&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; actually returns a new object which is again being referenced by
the name &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, when dealing with &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; arrays, this will lead to trouble.
When assigning to an array, it's &lt;code&gt;dtype&lt;/code&gt; is not changed and hence the
trouble.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The right way to use the augmented assignment operator, would be:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;

&lt;pre class="src src-python"&gt;import numpy
a = numpy.array([1,2], dtype=complex)
a += 0.5j
print a
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The same thing is explained in this thread.  Also, Thanks to
Bhanukiran for asking me this.

I'm now officially a part of the Arch Linux community! Arch Linux
is a lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to
Keep It Simple.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have started using arch from less than a week or so. It took me
a while, not too long, to realize the beauty of this distro. I was
trying to tweak the settings of my org-mode's remember (on
Karmic), trying to make it work the way I liked it. After breaking
my head with .emacs and lisp for a while, I realized the version
of my org-mode was way different from the version of the docs, I
was reading. It didn't take long to figure out, which version of
org-mode to get. As a matter of curiosity, I checked AUR for the
version, and true to Arch's reputation it was bleeding edge! I was
still using Karmic, since I hadn't got my Arch installation
working the way I like it, yet. Out of laziness. sudo reboot; to
hell with laziness!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was setting up things I regularly use, tweaking my way
around. After a day or so, I find python-numpy is out of date. And
to top it, an orphaned package! I didn't feel one bit good about
this. After some futile attempts to suppress my discomfort, I sat
down to work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After an afternoon of effort, I created my first PKGBUILD. :) I
now have python-numpy installed using pacman! Pleasure to join the
Arch User Community! Also, thanks to lifeeth and Lynus Vaz, for
the sparks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
PS: I'm using Arch with Openbox. It's neat! PPS: org-mode is
really awesome! It's a world in itself. life in plain text,
truly!]
