Yes, I've turned 21 today. I'd like to write a post today, but
this song (by Adam Sandler?) more or less conveys, how I feel.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'd just like to thank everyone, who prays for me to grow up and
not just old.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Happy Birthday Song&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Once a year we celebrate&lt;br&gt;
With stupid hats and plastic plates&lt;br&gt;
The fact that you were able to make&lt;br&gt;
Another trip around the sun&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And the whole clan gathers round&lt;br&gt;
And gifts and laughter do abound&lt;br&gt;
And we let out a joyful sound&lt;br&gt;
And sing that stupid song&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday!&lt;br&gt;
Now you're one year older!&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday!&lt;br&gt;
Your life still isn't over!&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday!&lt;br&gt;
You did not accomplish much&lt;br&gt;
But you didn't die this year&lt;br&gt;
I guess that's good enough&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So let's drink to your fading health&lt;br&gt;
And hope you don't remind yourself&lt;br&gt;
The chance of finding fame and wealth&lt;br&gt;
Decrease with every year&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Does it feel like you're doing laps&lt;br&gt;
And eating food and taking naps&lt;br&gt;
And hoping that someday perhaps&lt;br&gt;
Your life will hold some cheer&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday!&lt;br&gt;
What have you done that matters?&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday!&lt;br&gt;
You're starting to get fatter&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday!&lt;br&gt;
It's downhill from now on&lt;br&gt;
Try not to remind yourself&lt;br&gt;
Your best years are all gone&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If cryogenics were all free&lt;br&gt;
Then you could live like Walt Disney&lt;br&gt;
And live for all eternity&lt;br&gt;
Inside a block of ice&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But instead your time is set&lt;br&gt;
This is the only life you get&lt;br&gt;
And though it hasn't ended yet&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes you wish it might&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday!&lt;br&gt;
You wish you had more money&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday!&lt;br&gt;
Your life's so sad it's funny&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday!&lt;br&gt;
How much more can you take?&lt;br&gt;
But your friends are hungry&lt;br&gt;
So just cut the stupid cake&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday!&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday!&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday, dearâ€¦&lt;br&gt;

On a day, Wonderful,&lt;br&gt;
'm filled with emotion&lt;br&gt;
inexpressible&lt;br&gt;
for, I think of&lt;br&gt;
all that we share.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On a day that's Special,&lt;br&gt;
for the World,&lt;br&gt;
not just yet may be,&lt;br&gt;
my heart rejoices&lt;br&gt;
in the light you fill me with.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On a day, epochal&lt;br&gt;
I just hope, you enjoy&lt;br&gt;
all that the World's given&lt;br&gt;
and celebrate for&lt;br&gt;
all the difference you make&lt;br&gt;
in the World of some.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On this day,&lt;br&gt;
overwhelmed, with lots to convey,&lt;br&gt;
silence, I choose,&lt;br&gt;
for, it speaks louder than words.&lt;br&gt;
I just say,&lt;br&gt;
Happy Birthday, mate.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
my 50th post; A poem, I wrote a few weeks ago; A poem or is it doggerel?;
Something I wrote for a chum, that gives me courage to write more.

As I start this post, the rear-part of my body aches, after a nice
thrashing from the hostel junta. Apparently this is my gift on
having incremented my account of revolutions, around a big ball of
gases. (The total now moves on to 20) [isn't this apparent credit,
really a debit?] It was more than compensated for, with a lovely
cake though.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I just want to thank all the junta, [relatives and friends and
enemies and everyone else], who love me for what I am, even if all
they get back is stupidity, imperfection, insincerity, hypocrisy
and all sorts of crap. Thanks to everyone who pray for me to grow,
up and not just old. Thanks a Million.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A couple of decades through, and still no idea where life's taking
me. Isn't LIFE an opportunity that we need to make the most out
of?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Just hoping, this year gives me some wisdom, a little courage and
a lot more love to make the most of this opportunity.
