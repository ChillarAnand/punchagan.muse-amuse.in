I am beginning to notice something about my posts [ok.. there
aren't many that make it here.. :P] There are sometimes, when I
feel I should write about a specific thing. I feel as if, there
has to be a post about this, and there's no way I can't write
about it.
</p>

<p>
But then I have limited access to net here… and even less time
when I'm alone, to write up something. I definitely cannot access
net immediately, whenever I get that 'feel' to write about
something. So the post is postponed…  And later, when I think
about it, or do get access to net… it seems that topic isn't
worth writing.. or that 'feel' isn't there anymore..
</p>

<p>
I wonder if this would have been the case with my other posts
too.. if only I waited longer to post them?? [But on reading some
of the older posts I don't feel so much that way…] Am I being
lazy?? [Is this how other blogs die down?] Is it that my life is
dull and boring here (if it was so bad.. I guess I would've
managed to write about boredom! :P).. and there's nothing worth
writing? [and I am just thinking of something to keep my blog
alive?]  Is my blog closer to its end than it is to its beginning?
[I don't think so.. its only a matter of time before I get back to
coll.. :P] But is it the best way to be posting
[instinctively… immediately]??? Or is there something better
that I should be learning.. that I should have learnt by now??
</p>

<p>
BTW.. why do people blog at all?? What's the whole point of
Blogging? [Yes, I haven't still understood what it is.. even after
about 30 posts…]

Writing from Delhi, doing my PS at NPL! One would imagine, that I
am here enjoying myself; that I am enjoying thoroughly the
exposure I am getting to the world of Physics at a Research Level;
that I am spending each moment, inspired. But things haven't been
so rosy here… until today! [All this while I had been only doing
a lot of mechanical labor, very unhappily…]
</p>

<p>
Its around 12 noon, when I get a call, in the lab, from my guide
asking me to come down to room no. so and so. I had no idea what
that room had, or why I had been called. I enter and I am lead to
another room inside. I enter and there's a huge machine. (first
look, reminded me of Vickers' Hardness Testing Machine, that we
had in Lab at coll and I had a test on using it!) and its called a
TEM. But when I got closer, I fell in love with it! I dunno how
and why, but it looked simply amazing and extremely lovely to me
[Nothing like the Vickers' machine]. A 25 to 30 year old machine,
lots of controls all over it, lots of circuitry out in the
open… absolutely awe-inspiring..[though I knew nothing about
them.]
</p>

<p>
And then came the moment. The lights in the room were turned off,
and slowly and steadily the beam intensity of the TEM was
increased. Gradually the Greenish Fluoroscent Screen (displaying a
sample magnified X27,000) came to life… with control lights
blinking here and there… in the darkness of the room.It was
absolutely amazing; A great feeling. Though I was in there for a
very short while… an absolutely unforgettable experience; and
will remain so, for the rest of my life.
</p>

<p>
Now, it doesn't matter to me even if I don't learn much, during
the training period, I don't mind doing any kind-of mechanical
work, I don't mind not getting any results from my work,
whatever… it doesn't matter any more. This one moment; that's
all that matters.

        <div class="post"> <p>
Phew! I'm back home after one of my worst semesters so far. [there
have been only 4 upto now!! :P] {Also, not one of the better ones
grades-wise, but otherwise?? anyways.. forget it.. } From today
on, the lives of 2,27,483 young boys and girls [with the exception
of a few thousands] (in that part of the World called Andhra
Pradesh) will never be the same again. The so called verdict on
their lives (yes, the verdict of their lives!!) has been
pronounced at 11:45am today. EAMCET-07 [Engineering, Agriculture
and Medicine Common Entrance Test] results announced. This is no
more a matter of anxious students checking out, how they fared in
comparison to others of their age. It's no more a matter of
getting into Under-grad to come out a Grad in a chosen discipline.
</p>

<p>
"The Hottest Topic" in town. Nobody's left out of it. Young or
Old, Rich or Poor, Stout or Slim, Tall or Short, Theist or
Atheist, Engineers or Doctors, Black or White. "Black or White"??
How could I and those around me be left out?
</p>

<p>
Here's a little from what i see… [Is a little exaggeration
allowed?]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An ad on the FM… "ee karyakramanni
samarpinchindi… engineering vijethala mata.. bata.. Sri
chaitanya.." [This programme is brought to you by… Sri
Chaitanya.. the voice and choice of Engineering Winners!!]
</li>
<li>Another ad. Neti EAMCET phalitalalo kooda atyuttamaina vijayala
tho… Narayana.. [With the most wonderful victories even in
this time's EAMCET, Narayana] {Sri Chaitanya and Narayana are
two very popular Junior Colleges here.. with hazaar
franchises.. all over the State}
</li>
<li>A : How did your neighbor's cousin's friend's daughter's friend
do? [ob exaggerated] B : She didn't do quite well. It seems she
didn't study the I yr syllabus properly!! {How did he ever get
to know that?!!?!?}
</li>
<li>Me : Where's A? Why's he so late? J.H : His sister's Medicine
results are out. She scored 700! A local rank of 10! She'll get
into any place she chooses. Me : That's cool. So that guys gone
for a party or what? J.H : No he's consoling his sister! She's
weeping for she expect to score a rank close to 300! Me : Oh
c'mon!!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why the hell is the whole state dragged into this? Can't the guys
n gals be left alone? Why is that a little thing as a test that
allocates various grad seats to the students, blown out of
proportion? Do we need big Corporate giants fighting for the ranks
and cash of aspiring students? Why all the hue and cry??
</p>

<p>
Isn't is possible for these people to have a normal life, where
these CET's are just a part of their lives and not their LIVES
themselves? Can't they be doing other things along with preparing
to get into a good grad school? Do we wish to have Engineers and
Doctors who, all through the best couple of years of their lives,
were busy grinding, swallowing and puking out heaps and heaps of
books just to get one seat in a Grad School?
</p>

<p>
Will things ever be normal again? When will kids "here" start
being kids? When will the parents and teachers and all the zillion
others understand that their kids need to be given everything in
life, exposed to everything. Not just dumping in gallons of
formulae and tons of equations. Will people ever give CETs just
that much attention as it deserves, and not make it a big issue
all over the state? When will the EAMCET stop being the lives of
college students and start being just a part of their lives??
</p>

<p>
[I have tried my best to portray the situation, in this part of
the World. But it is quite possible that I didn't do it well
enough….]
