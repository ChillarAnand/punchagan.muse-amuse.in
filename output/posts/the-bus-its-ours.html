I hadn't been much in the City for the past three years. I've had
a little trouble recollecting the exact routes and corresponding
bus numbers. I Googled for it, with little hope, and the results
didn't surprise me. There wasn't much info in this regard. On the
occasion of World Environment, when the focus is on promoting the
use of Public Transport, this isn't a very encouraging sign.
</p>

<p>
I was wondering if the Bus route info can somehow be integrated
with Google maps or the like. This will be a good thing to do,
since people who have access to internet (the higher rungs of the
society) are the ones who are most aware of the threats to the
Environment and also the ones who least use public transport. This
could help them do some planning and encourage use of public
transport. Later on, may be the Buses could have some kind of a
GPS sytem that could be interlinked with the maps, giving people
great power! I'm not sure if this already exists elsewhere in the
world, but seemed an interesting thing to do.
</p>

<p>
On a different note, just wanted to share this different
perspective my mom was giving to my 7 year old neice. We were on a
bus and my niece wasn't very happy about the crowd and the Bus
journey. My mom, then said something, probably to amuse the kid
and distract her for a while. But its an interesting way of
looking at things.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You should be proud that you are aboard a bus that costs around 15
lacs, something we wouldn't normally be able to buy. And that too
for a small sum of Rs. 5. You are being driven around by a
chauffeur employed by the State Govt. and you needn't bother
yourself with the routes and other headaches of driving you'd have
if you used your personal car…
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The kid wasn't convinced or even amused by this, but I liked the
interesting observation. Some food for thought, My mom travels for
an hour and half by bus to reach her work and she's been doing so
since I was a kid of 5 or 6. Now I know why she's been able to do
it for so many years, everyday!
