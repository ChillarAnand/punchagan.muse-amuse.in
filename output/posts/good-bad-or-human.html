Well, this could be called a post after ages, considering that
most of previous posts have just been 'news reports'. I have been
wanting to make a post since long, but I probably lost it. I
really am unable to write anything that I find worth posting [It
does raise questions about the existence of this blog. I'm writing
this, to answer that question to myself.]
</p>

<p>
This post is provoked by an act of sharing, an act of kindness, an
act of goodness, that surprised me. This post isn't about the act
itself, but it's about me being surprised. Why on earth should I
(or anybody) be surprised, when someone is just being human?
Aren't human beings meant to be and feel human?
</p>

<p>
I wonder why people say, "this is a bad, bad world." I find a lot
of goodness and humanness around me. Unless I strain my memory
really hard, I can only recall people who try to be as good and
nice as they can be; People trying to be as human as
possible. Either there's something utterly wrong with my judgment
of people or there's something wrong with the general feeling that
the world is a bad, bad place.
</p>

<p>
There's one other possibility that just strikes me - I am so nice
to people that, everyone else tries to be nice with me. I don't
think I am such a big deviation from the average. I'm just another
goat, in the great herd.
</p>

<p>
And another one, I'm in a really special place, presently. I have
been only to the special places. I have visited only the places
that are at an extreme, far away from the 'average' place in the
world. But, given I'm just another goat in the great herd, this is
very unlikely. I am probably grazing at a random spot on the great
grasslands.
</p>

<p>
Since these are ruled out, it boils down to either a wrong
judgment or a wrong general feeling.
</p>

<p>
Coming to my judgment, I wouldn't call myself an Oracle or the
wise one, but I'm no dumb ass either. Well, taking the statistical
route, the number of times I've had any real "nasty" surprises in
dealing with people has been much lesser than the number of times
things turned out nearly as expected. My judgment could,
therefore, possibly given some credibility.
</p>

<p>
So, that leaves me with just one possibility. The idea that the
world is a bad, bad place is not entirely true, if not completely
absurd and outright wrong. The world is really a nice place, with
"human" beings inhabiting it. The nasty surprises that you get,
really are the surprises and not the general rule.
