  I accidentally came across the blog-post Git-powered wikis
  improved - GitHub. And this particular paragraph caught my
  eye:

  #+begin_quote
    The new editor has the capability to support every markup
    language that GitHub Wikis support. If you're a fan of Markdown,
    Textile, pod or RDoc, the function bar buttons (e.g. bold,
    italic, underline, etc.) will now work. We've even written brand
    new inline help for many of GitHub Wiki's supported markup
    languages.

    The language definitions the editor uses are JSON-based and easy
    to edit. If you'd like us to support a markup language that we
    don't currently support, Gollum, GitHub's wiki software, is
    entirely open source -- fork our code and send us a pull request
    with changes that support your choice language.
  #+end_quote

  I sent a quick patch for org-mode in the function bar, and it has
  been accepted.  :)

  If not anything more, I hope, at least a couple of curious people
  will explore org-mode and find it useful.
