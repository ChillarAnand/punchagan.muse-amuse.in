  A small utility function that I used to sort the names of people
  who commented on my blog.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :syntaxhl
    (defun org-get-link-desc-from-list ()
      """ Get link description of a list item containing just links """
      (let* ((item-beg (point))
           (item-end (org-end-of-item))
           (cur-item (buffer-substring-no-properties
                      item-beg item-end)))
        (goto-char item-beg)
        (org-columns-compact-links cur-item)))
  #+end_src

  ~sort-lines~ wasn't good enough for me, since it was sorting
  alphabetically and it ended up being the sorted order of the urls
  and not the names. This function, when used with
  ~org-sort-entries-or-items~ gave me what I wanted.

  Thanks to benny (on #org-mode), I also learnt the difference
  between ~let~ and ~let*~.
