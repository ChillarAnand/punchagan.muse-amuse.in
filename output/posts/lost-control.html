<b>Caution</b>: This post is just some arbit crap, that arose from some
 internal probing. Its utterly worthless for any reader other than
 myself. This could possibly even be classified narcissistic or
 whatever that's called.
</p>

<p>
Presently, I've got tests going on and they are half way
through. Considering this and the fact that its been over a month
since I last posted, writing a post now doesn't make much sense,
does it?[If my blog's been dormant so long, can't it be so for a
couple of days more?] But things I've been up to off-late, don't
make much sense. [in the past, at least they made sense to me if
not to others.] This post is just about that, going from being
senseless to at least being less sense [and hopefully, to being
sensible]
</p>

<p>
I've screwed up the tests so far, and don't think will be doing
much better in the others too. Even otherwise, I haven't done
anything good, anything that feels great, anything that feels
right, in the past couple of months (years?? decades??) [except
for one video with 'the gang', i didn't contribute much
though]. Let alone accomplishing something nice, I haven't even
been attempting anything decent enough. My priorities have gone
haywire, or may be not, may be I'm just doing things that are very
low on the scale or may be I'm not doing anything, things are just
hapenning.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I've slept through 'n' classes both inside and outside the
classroom
</li>
<li>I've stayed awake all night downloading some crap for my comp.
</li>
<li>I had been worrying about keeping my blog alive. Made numerous
attempts to post something, even if its no big deal not posting
regularly.
</li>
<li>Changed 4 different OSes in a couple of days!
</li>
<li>been ages since I last visited the Library.
</li>
<li>Slept through the morning lotsa times, even if I enjoy EBER-ing
</li>
<li>Bunked bathing just because i'll have more clothes to wash!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The list is pretty long. It ain't sensible to be putting down the
whole thing here.&lt;/ul&gt; I guess I've just been trying to escape
things. Running from doing important stuff. I've had enough. Its
high time I do something about it. I've decided to get in control
of my life, rather than being controlled by arbit stuff like
sleep, a blog, a grade, an addiction, a song, a cricket match, a
rain, a meal, a game of carrom, a prof's accent, a course, a test
or other such trivialities.
</p>

<p>
I wish to get back on track!!
</p>

<p>
..to get back into the habit of doing things I love, at the time
and place I like.
</p>

<p>
..to doing things that give me joy, in the true sense. Not
momentary, passing pleasures.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, with some effort, I will. (A nudge is all it takes.)
</p>

<p>
btw, if this post was a total bouncer, this is for you….
