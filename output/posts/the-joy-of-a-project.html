Just finished the 'Test-2'. Here's the first
post that can genuinely be called "mine"…
</p>

<p>
With my last minute 'C2S' plans [Co-operate to Survive… does it
ring any bells??] failing to work, the tests did their job,cleaned
me up [both literally and metaphorically]. Though I didn't learn
much while preparing for the tests, the syllabus gave me a brain
wave (surprised to find that my Brain is still ticking…. after
more than one year of Engg.) : Build my first Computer game!!
[Don't expect too much from it… I'm a novice at programming and
my game doesn't even have a GUI as of now!]
</p>

<p>
I had been doing a l'l bit of C programming off late but, I never
learnt 'file management' until the "Test-2" forced me to, and
Viola! I embarked on a self assigned, "Project - Hangman".
</p>

<p>
Here's a peek at the game… [after a lot of
testing and debugging (the use of technical terms is just a matter
of "phantee")]
</p>

<p>
"Phantee"- a typical hyderabadi term; has no literal english
translation; refers to "concealing ignorance in style" ??
</p>

<p>
The basics were quite simple and were done in
two hours… but then began the real test! The program needed a
lot of improvements to make it "Playable" but, the tests were less
than a week away.
</p>

<p>
I managed to find enough time even during the
tests (it doesn't really matter whether you spend a week, a day or
just an hour mugging - you are bound to be cleaned up!), and
finished most of the stuff within a week.
</p>

<p>
There were quite a few road blocks which I had to get
around. Amongst other things, obtaining a 'decent' database of
words was one. Initially, I wrote another program for building up
a dbase of your own. This wasn't good enough…. so, with some
ideas from Arunodai, I successfully integrated a dbase of 14000
words [picked it from another version of hangman] with my own
version. After one whole week of debugging and improving {with an
annoying disturbance called 'Test-2'}, now my game is quite
'playable' (i.e it can be played by people other than me).
</p>

<p>
So you might say, "what's the big-deal about writing a simple
program of about hundred lines, that can randomly display words
and check if you guess it right within seven turns?". This l'll
project of mine may seem like a Pro'jest' to many! [writing a
complex code, messing it up, debugging it for one whole week, etc
just for the sake of creating a simple game, that can be played if
you have a friend,a pen and a paper. Doing so much&lt;span
class="text"&gt; for a game, that already has 'n' version,
seems very foolish and a collosal waste
of time and effort. Doesn't it??] Obviously, that's not a great
achievement, its not something thats worth a mention in the
Guiness Book of World Records or something. But it taught me a lot
of stuff, stuff that you can't learn from books,stuff that you
can't learn by mugging [I wonder if you can learn anything under
the sun by "Mugging"], stuff that you can only learn by
experience.I learnt a lot more of Computer Programming through
this project, than I learnt through two, '3-point' courses!! {Of
course, I wouldn't have even dreamt of doing such a thing, if not
for these two courses, that introduced me to programming and
taught me the essentials}. Can't such projects make the other
courses a joy too?
</p>

<p>
This brings me to our recent TRW [Technical Report Writing]
project. You might wonder what kind of projects could be given in
this kind of a course. We were asked to write a report on 'Waste
Management' in our college, and to include some suggestions on the
ways to improve it. Though this was an interesting job, with scope
for some field activity and other such stuff, we [a group of six
members] successfully turned the 'project' into a Pro'jest'!!
[that's my personal view; the others in the group may
disagree].But still, we learnt a lot on Report writing. A lot more
than what we learnt by reading pages and pages of instructions, on
the techniques of writing good reports,by the so called experts.
</p>

<p>
Both the projects helped me understand stuff better and to put
them to use. Why can't all courses have little projects, along
with the routine stuff? Will it not improve my understanding of
the subject matter? Will I not learn a great deal of things more
than I do by mugging things up, just a week before the tests? Will
it not be an experience, a lesson, of its own??
</p>

<p>
I wonder if my "Engineering", will ever be a joy for me?
</p>

<p>
I am looking forward to more Projects… to make engineering a joy
for me!! [it doesn't matter even if they're self-assigned ;-) ]
