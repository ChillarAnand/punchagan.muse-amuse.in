A couple of days back.. one guy called green<sub>mamba</sub> asked me.. "Why
do you use Linux (GNU/Linux) and not Windows? What is it that
makes LinuxGNU/Linux] so special for you?" I avoided that
question then.. {I was in no mood of answering questions… Exams
had finished just the day before!!}  I am trying to answer it
now… green<sub>mamba</sub> also told me that Roopesh said, "I use it
because I can look at the source code. I am allowed to look at how
things work and fiddle with the way they work!"… I knew it
immediately that this was not the reason for me.[I rarely looked
at source code… and making changes to it.. haha..] So what is
it? I think I can answer this question if I get back to the time
when I started using Linux…[hehe.. not too long ago!! :P]
</p>

<p>
So how did I start using GNU/Linux? How did "we" first meet? It
was during last summer holidays.. that Voods sent me this link
… [I had definitely used GNU/Linux on a few occasions
before… but.. this was when I really began using it…] and
within hours I was a fan of GNU/Linux!![and Richard M Stallman
(RMS)]
</p>

<p>
So its the "philosophy"… The philosophy of Free
Software… [Free as in Freedom, not as in Free Beer…(English is
a wierd wierd Language…)]… The philosophy of Open
Source… that brought me to it… This song says it the best…

<p>
now I continue to use it.. for a variety of reasons..[they are NOT
in the order of their priority/importance]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Firstly, using Linux gives me a sense of community… a sense of
oneness [this can't happen with Windows.. because you can't
share stuff… :-(]
</li>
<li>I have begun to hate the concept of Proprietary Software… can
you believe that.. "Sharing stuff..  makes us PIRATES!!"
</li>

<li>I am a growing fan of the Command Line… It simply rocks!!
</li>

<li>There's almost no problem of Viruses/Malware.. You simply don't
need an Anti-Virus..(that needs to be updated every night.. or
u'll have nightmares…)
</li>

<li>Then there's this wonderful concept of Live-CDs.. {specially
Knoppix.. Its absolutely awesome!} It put me(us?) out of
soup… a lotta times…
</li>

<li>The fiddle factor… I have just started to fiddle with
things(…source codes… I added a small feature to my
dc-client Microdc2].. the feature of away messages.. it feels
gr8! :P)
</li>

<li>One of my best friend is using it too! [you know who…]
</li>

<li>The Mascot looks cool!! ;) [I liked the GNU mascot too! (It's on
my side-bar) ]
</li>

<li>The name "LINUX"!! [There's so many flavors(Distros) of
Linux.. that I can keep trying different ones.. all my
life :P.. presently with Slackware!]
</li>

<li>Its Fun!! and I want to use it…
</li>

<li>and finally… Windows sucks! [I don't have to use it… :P]!!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Value your freedom or you will lose it, teaches history. "Don't
bother us with politics," respond those who don't want to learn.
–Richard Stallman
</p>

<p>
When you say, "I wrote a program that crashed Windows", people
just stare at you blankly and say, "Hey, I got those with the
system, for free".  –Linus Torvalds
</p>

<p>
"What happens when you read some doc and either it doesn't answer
 your question or is demonstrably wrong? In Linux, you say "Linux
 sucks" and go read the code. In Windows/Oracle/etc you say
 "Windows sucks" and start banging your head against the wall."
 — Denis Vlasenko on linux kernel mailing list

There's a post already with 'exactly' this name…. by 9… here…
But this post doesn't have much to do with his post… [or may be it does??]
</p>

<p>
Here's a Quote on Mahatma Gandhi…
/Generations to come, it may be, will scarcely believe that such a
one, as this, ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. –
Albert Einstein/
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering…. what would happen if the name Albert
Einstein was replaced by punchagan… and it turned out
that.. there's a huge huge list of candidates for replacing
Mahatma Gandhi… [This is with due respect to the Mahatma and
Einstein.. I don't, in any sense, intend to say that the Mahatma
was not a Mahatma…]
</p>

<p>
All I want to say is… I am seeing a whole lot of new things, in
people around me, that inspire awe and respect in me… that every
person is unique… every person is special.. every person can
teach you something…. there's something to learn from
everyperson… that makes me believe God,truly, created man in his
own image…
</p>

<p>
I am grateful to all the people around me (and those not around
any more..)… who have shown, are showing, and will be showing me
things bright and beautiful… wise and wonderful… which
otherwise I would have failed to see..
</p>

<p>
I am grateful… for getting me back on track.. when i go
directionless,.. for setting me examples to emulate,… for being
with me whenever i needed and will need you…
</p>

that's too big a job for this little being to achieve… ]

As William Arthur Ward says….

<blockquote>
<p>
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
and not giving it.

<p>
To All Jaani's of the World… Thanks a Lot… (I know that's too
small a word… but that's all I can give right now…)

then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We
should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner

A few days back I received a letter from a friend, via post! [I
know most of you can't believe this… but ya.. its true..] I
wouldn't have believed it too… if only he didn't tell that to me
when we met online… {He spoilt the fun for me! :-(} So before
going to dinner one day…(a couple of weeks back..).. I checked
out the Hostel Assistants room for any post…. and "it" was right
on top of the pile!! [Now that I speak of a pile don't imagine
that a lot of people here get personal letters… most of them
were business correspondence, magazines or likewise…]
Neways.. it was a great feeling to even look at it!! A white
envelope… and my name on it.. in his most familiar writing on
it…[no.. i don't get letters from him often.. we have been
classmates for quite some time.. so…] … the stamp [A leapard
cat!]… and the two postmarks.. [of Pilani &amp;amp;
Zuarinagar!! :-P]… Holding the letter in my hand.. it felt
wonderful!! [I wanted to read it right then…. but went along for
dinner…]
</p>

<p>
After dinner… and a little time in the Children's
Park… [relaxing.. wid 9,UC,Voodoo n Ringo]… I opened it! It
was absolutely thrilling… to see a couple of pages written in
ink [he still uses ink pens!! ;-)]… With full enthu.. i read the
letter.. and obviously once wasn't enough to satiate my hunger.. i
went through it over and over and over… [i wanted to scribble
down a reply ASAP… but we had waves and quark coming up.. so i
waited for them to get over (I could've written another one
right??)…to get more matter into my letter..]
</p>

<p>
Why is such a simple joy of getting a letter from a friend [there
is email.. but… for me its nowhere close to snail mail…]
become so rare these days?? [Something that was such a regular
feature of the recent past.. is almost extinct now!!] Telephone
and the Internet…. they are the culprits… (are they??…..) In
today's global village… is post a bit too slow for comfort? Will
survival of the fittest ensure the extiction of this wonderful
species in the world of communication…??
</p>

<p>
Is a letter just a matter of communication…?… Isn't there
anything more to it… [Obviously there is… otherwise I wouldn't
be writing a blog-post on it…I would never think of writing a
post on an e-mail I get!! (unless it is superhuman.. or
something..)!!] Aren't we losing out on something wonderful??

Such wonderful things they are… bringing to us.. such a joy
[even if its about something not so pleasant…]… the joy of
discovering things.. of realising a truth… that was hidden
somewhere within… brought out with an elegant swoooosh!!…
</p>

<p>
We, 9, Voodoo, Ravi, UC n me] were just walking on the
street… enjoying the evening… after a nice day @ Quark [Day
2]… We were having a casual discussion… not discussing
anything in particular… but somehow the discussion led to a
project uc,ravi n me [ and probably the others are too..(they
didn't talk abt it…)] are interested in… [i don't wanna give
any more info abt the project.. bcos it may seem over-ambitious to
a few.. not that it hasn't been done already…. but…]
neways….
</p>

<p>
so… while we were talkin abt it… uc said, he didn't have any
clue about that thing worked… and we all were wondering
too… thinking about some possible solutions/methods….[I was
actually trying to recollect something i came across… some time
back…] but then suddenly 9 jumped in, to say…
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Don't think about how 'that' works… Just think about how 'YOU'
would make it work!!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh my God!! now that's what's a REVELATION… I was just
dumb-struck… that one small statement of his… drowned me in
its depths… I feel I still haven't come out of it… A big big
revelation at the most unexpected of times, at the most unexpected
of places…. [though 9 wouldn't agree with this… being his
usual modest self…]
</p>

<p>
Its been proved time and again… "they" can occur
anywhere… anytime and to anyone… while you are on the
street.. in your room.. at work… or even in the loo… [Most ppl
have a lot of them here!!].. we just need to keep our eyes n ears
open… and most importantly our Mind……  ps: it seems…me not
delving out the details about our ambitious project.. makes this
post a little vague, uninteresting n difficult to relate to… but
still…  In the fields of observation chance favors only the
prepared mind –Louis Pasteur

I was just wondering if we really needed such extravagant
stuff… I know that such events bring ppl together… but do we
need to spend so much money just to have a have a good dance with
friends?? When a large number of people aren't able to get their
basic neccessities like a Square Meal, Clean drinking water,
proper clothing and shelter… here we are enjoying a good dance
with friends… with elaborately made extravagant
arrangements… [of course the money isn't ours… but…] [ I
know a lot of guys wud've a lot to say against me…. but.. its
ok..]
</p>

<p>
There can't be perfect equality in this world… of which duality
is an integral part…. every elementary particle has a dual
nature… so its but obvious that every thing in this world has a
dual to it… so its not possible to have a perfect world with
everybody equally placed.. if there is a rich.. then there will be
a poor… if there is joy.. then there will be despair… if there
is light.. then there will be darkness…
</p>

<p>
But can't we do anything… can't we spread the light to every
place that we possibly could?? Can't we get together to minimize
the difference? Join the race against nature… do your bit…
</p>

<p>
This, probably, is a good place to start off…

Imagine a kid reading Shakespeare's Othello or As You Like
it…[or may be some other classic poem…] with great difficulty
he somehow manages to read the whole thing… [with all the
archaic language etc..] he understands the basic plot and the
story and likes it… but will he be able to appreciate the work?
Will he be able to see the beauty of it?? Isn't a good knowledge
of Language a bare essential for one to enjoy a Literary work??
</p>

<p>
Now consider a layman… listening to Classical [say Carnatic]
Music… if he's got no knowledge of the Basic structure and
organisation of Music in general or a Raga in particular.. then he
may enjoy the musical work… listen to it happily…. but will he
get the taste of its nectar from the fine intricacies in it??
Isn't a basic sense of Music… a knowledge of the language of
Music necessary to understand the fine points of a Musical piece??
</p>

<p>
Isn't the case similar with Science [Feynman says nature..]??
Without a proper knowledge base in Mathematics.. how would I
possibly understand and appreciate Physics/Science (in general..)
and Relativity in particular?? [I got this feeling, after class
today, for the zillionth time…] How can I possibly enjoy a
course in Relativity without a proper Math background???
</p>

<p>
I need to learn a lot of Mathematics.. its high time I do it… :(
</p>

<p>
To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across
a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature
… If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is
necessary to understand the language that she speaks in.
–Richard P. Feynman

Popular opinion isn't everything….. Its not necessary that we
always go with the popular opinion, or take that option which most
people endorse.. here's a case in point… an article by Paul
Graham..(You can also read it @
