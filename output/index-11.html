Just back after attending PyCon India '10. It was not as exciting
as I hoped it would be.  That's generally the case with any
conference I attend.  (I guess, I expect too much from them. :P)
</p>

<p>
The keynote by David Goodger (pronounced like Badger :) was
"Good".  It was a very simple one talking of how to get Python
into the workplace.  His simple recommendation was to use Python
if we saw any opportunity where it could be used, without
bothering about permissions, convincing people etc.  "It's better
to ask for forgiveness, than for permission."  He spoke of myths
around Python – scripting language, dynamic language, too much
white space, toy language, nobody uses it.  He concluded the talk,
by saying mentioning Indian driving to be an indication of some
quick reflexes that we Indians have. ;) On the whole it was an
enlightening, humorous and enjoyable talk.
</p>

<p>
I didn't attend too many of other talks.  Amongst the ones that I
did attend, I particularly liked the one by Asim Mittal on using
the Nintendo Wii with Python.
</p>

<p>
On some thought about my experiences at conferences, I think
conferences shouldn't have any talks at all.  Or atleast, I
shouldn't be attending conferences for talks.  They are an excuse
to catch-up with people.  Conferences should have only lightning
talks of 10 mins and sprints.  Talks, with an extensive
explanation of stuff that can be easily found on the web, are a
waste of time.

I had a strict character limit of 180 chars for something I was

region or a buffer. Another function to count the words.

Should one take the easy route of asking someone who knows, if she
is sitting right next to you? Or should we try and find out first,
before asking her? Should one value his time more than others' or
others' time more than his own?
</p>

<p>
Would we learn more if we tried to find out ourselves? Does
learning more, make sense? Is it worth spending the extra time?
</p>

<p>
I'm just talking of simple things that you could figure out by
spending a couple of minutes of searching the web or 5 minutes of
thinking or 10 minutes of reading a book.

I now have a GNU! I bought it (a GNU soft toy) in memory of my friend
swathanthran from #emacs-in.  RIP swathanthran
</p>

<p>
As a bonus, I got the chance to have a photograph with just RMS and
me. Also, hoping the monetary contribution will be of some use to
FSF-India.
</p>

<p>
The thrill of getting the GNU (and the GNU itself) and shaking hands,
getting photographed with RMS is dedicated to all the lafoots and
specially to Voodoo, who taught me the meaning of the word "hacker".
</p>

<p>
Happy Hacking!
</p>

<p>
ps: I just hope and pray nobody else does anything as stupid and
shocking as what swathanthran did.

Well, it turned out to be not so Happy. I came to know of this
sad news. A prof published his students' work as his own, with
no mention of their names! This guy is such a shame to his
profession! Shame!

<p>
I wonder how this guy has even been able to sleep every night.
Isn't there something called a conscience?

RMS will be in IIT-Bombay on the 6th of this month. He will "speak
about the goals and philosophy of the Free Software Movement, and
the status and history of the GNU operating system, which in
combination with the kernel Linux is now used by tens of millions
of users world-wide. "

We, Ritesh and I, finished our first 100+km ride – approximately
110km. Yo!

<h2 id="sec-2">The Story</h2>

<p>
We started at around 0720 and were hoping to reach Karnala Bird
Sanctuary by around 1130.  We — actually, soot covered clones of
us —  reached by about 1215 or so.  That's pretty decent,
considering we were directed to Karnala sports complex, when we were
looking for bird sanctuary and there was quite a bit of traffic near
Panvel.
</p>

<p>
While we were getting tickets to get into the sanctuary, a man was
amused by Ritesh's polka (dirt) dotted shirt and asks us whether we
rode down from JNPT.  We got all excited and told him, that we rode
down from Powai!  He just said, "Gone Mad!" and walked away, as if
madness was contagious.  Both of us, felt great!  We were high!  It
felt like the best compliment to get after a long, tiring,
(blackening) ride.  We got in and rushed to a tap and almost had a
bath under it.  The first touch of cold water was heaven!  Just a
while later, we got a shock.  We couldn't get any food near/inside
the sanctuary.  We will have to go back 3 km for that.  We spent
about an hour and a half, getting some oxygen, looking for a few
birds, giving up and settling with spiders and clicking some
pictures.  We got went back 3km to the hotel and spent about an hour
there (not all of it eating ;). We started back at around 1515.
</p>

<p>
The ride back was eventful.  We took a slightly different route,
tempted by a free Highway(NH4), waiting to be rode on.  The road
looked awesome, with a hill on the left, and no vehicles in sight.
But, as fate would have it, Ritesh's rear tyre gave way.  After some
search we found a guy fixing tyres of vehicles on the highway.  But
he refused to fix our bicycle.  He refused even to fill air in it,
so we could reach the nearest cycle repair shop.  After more search,
we found who agreed to fill air in the tyre. (It needs a special
valve pin.  The previous guy, probably didn't have it. But we
could've hacked up something.)
</p>

<p>
We rushed to Kalamboli and got the tyre fixed.  Then we headed back
in the route that we had come on.  It'd been raining on and off
through out the morning.  But first rain on the return only started
near Nerul.  It was a great relief.  My cycle started moving more
smoothly…  I loved it.  We got lost a bit near Ghatkopar.  Also,
the traffic was quite bad there. (Why do drivers get so bad, once it
starts raining?  It's not unique to Mumbai, but quite visible here.
We were back in Campus by around 2040.
</p>

<p>
Ritesh was energized after the puncture was fixed.  He rode like
crazy, after that.  The sole of my feet started hurting —
something like a cramp.  I don't know what exactly happened.  Also,
my groin was hurting quite a bit.  My only motivation at that point
was seeing Ritesh ride like crazy.  He was at his best, then!  I'm
still wondering where he got all that energy from.  It was a great
ride, for both of us!  Motivating each other to keep going. :)
</p>

<p>
Ritesh, where to next?

<li>The Cycle needs to be as close to perfect, as it possibly can be.
</li>
<li>Carry your route map along. Enquiring the route a colossal waste
of time and sometimes unreliable, too.
</li>
<li>A pollution mask is a <b>must</b> for Mumbai (or any other city.)
</li>
<li>Carry enough water and food. (We drank about 7L of water between us)
</li>
<li>Need to learn how to fix punctures.  Need a tool kit.
</li>
<li>A helmet, shorts with padding would be good.
</li>
<li>An odometer would be useful too.
</li>
<li>Learn to use the hand-pump or carry along a normal pump.
</li>
<li>I should probably ride along with some Cycling group for the
experience of it. I'll get to learn a lot of things.

A small utility function that I used to sort the names of people
who commented on my blog.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun org-get-link-desc-from-list ()
  """ Get link description of a list item containing just links """
  (let* ((item-beg (point))
       (item-end (org-end-of-item))
       (cur-item (buffer-substring-no-properties
		  item-beg item-end)))
    (goto-char item-beg)
    (org-columns-compact-links cur-item)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>sort-lines</code> wasn't good enough for me, since it was sorting
alphabetically and it ended up being the sorted order of the urls
and not the names. This function, when used with
<code>org-sort-entries-or-items</code> gave me what I wanted.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to benny (on #org-mode), I also learnt the difference
between <code>let</code> and <code>let*</code>.

gora asked for some good links (on ##linux-india) to redirect
newbies, enthusiastic about contributing to FOSS.
</p>

<p>
I dug up a few links from the web - some that I read, when I
was starting off with using GNU/Linux and FOSS, others are
newer links.
</p>

<p>
Just making a note of them here; hoping someone would find it
useful.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How to Become a Hacker - A definitive how-to on becoming a
hacker. Answers all the right questions. :)
</li>

<li>Philosophy of the GNU Project - This is the page, where I
started. Thanks to Voodoo for giving me the link to this page. I
distinctly remember that day. :) I'm going to pass on this link
to any newbie who comes my way, no matter how much bashing I get
from other FOSS evangelists.
</li>

<li>6 Easy Ways To Get Started Programming Open Source - A neat list
giving steps to get started with programming for open source. I
like #4. Understanding the social dynamics of the project is an
important thing which is often overlooked by newbies.
</li>

<li>OpenHatch - A community site to help newbies get started with
contributing to FOSS. A cool site. Also, here is a story about
OpenHatch.
</li>

<li>Look at the Numbers! - an interesting paper giving quantitative
data in support of using FOSS.
</li>

<li>Ubuntu - Code of Conduct - A nice description of general conduct
expected in any of the FOSS communities, not just Ubuntu.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'd be happy to add any other links that any of you share. Thanks!
