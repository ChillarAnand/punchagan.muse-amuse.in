<li>In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is
then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We
should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner
spirit.  – <i>Albert Schweitzer, 1875 - 1965</i>
</li>

<li>Anyone who cannot cope with mathematics is not fully human.  At best
he is a tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe and
not make messes in the house.  – <i>Lazarus Long, Time Enough for
Love</i>
</li>

<li>You probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you
could know how seldom they do. – <i>Olin Miller</i>
</li>

<li>If you judge people, you have no time to love them. – <i>Mother Teresa</i>
</li>

<li>Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
and not giving it. – <i>William Arthur Ward</i>

<li><p class="verse">
Where the mind is without fear and the head held high;<br>
Where knowledge is free;<br>
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;<br>
Where words come out from the depth of truth;<br>
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;<br>
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;<br>
Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action;<br>
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Rabindranath Tagore – Let My Country Awake</i>

<li>The true Enlightenment thinker, the true rationalist, never wants to
talk anyone into anything. No, he does not even want to convince;
all the time he is aware that he may be wrong. Above all, he values
the intellectual independence of others too highly to want to
convince them in important matters. He would much rather invite
contradiction, preferably in the form of rational and disciplined
criticism. He seeks not to convince but to arouse — to challenge
others to form free opinions. – <i>Karl Popper – On Freedom</i>
</li>

<li>Don't ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you
come alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is
people who have come alive. – <i>Howard Thurman</i>
</li>

<li>All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't
hurt. – <i>Charles M Schultz</i>

balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take
orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze

I am unread.  Unlike you, who classify yourselves as well-read or
not, I am classified as unread or not.  Well, you could call me
not well-read too, I guess.  I was looked at once, my innards
glanced through, and was hurriedly marked as unread, starred and
tagged.  Given my length, the care with which I was composed, and
the flurry with which I was stowed away, I probably contain
something important, to be read at the opportune moment, something
to be cherished and to be replied to with diligence and care.  I
felt a sense of pride.
</p>

<p>
I got composed and sent weeks ago, and have been lying here
untouched, since.  I get buried deeper and deeper every day, with
a daily flood of newer stuff piling up onto me.  While my
composer, eagerly awaits a reply, (less and less eagerly each day,
though) I have lost all hope of being read and replied to.  I
curse myself for carrying something so important.  A thousand
other replies have been sent, and a few thousand others composed
here, but my turn hasn't come, yet.
</p>

<p>
How I wish, it'd be my turn today.  How I wish, I could push my
way up through to the top of the stack.  How I wish, I could see
the eager wait come to an end!  How I wish, I'm given the
attention I deserved, today!  Reply, ASAP!
</p>

<p>
PS: Apologies for all those emails that are still starred and
unread, in my Inbox…
