Or to celebrate the time\neveryone in the world had, to enjoy themselves. He walked past the\nskating rink, with lots of people having the time of their life ice\nskating, and a lot more, awaiting their turn. The first timers, old\nand young, making up for their inexperience, with their excitement;\nholding onto whatever they can, to finish their next round, to start\ntheir next.

The brilliantly lit skyline was a delight to watch, but I don't\nbelieve he saw any of it. He just stared into it, blankly. He kept\nstaring, as the night got chillier, and the neighborhood kept getting\nmore and more deserted. Seconds ticked away, minutes and hours passed\nby! He stayed on, staring ahead. It didn't matter how much below zero\nthe mercury had gone. This wasn't the first night he was spending\nstaring into the nothingness. It turned out to be the coldest night,\nin a decade. But that didn't matter to him. Nothing did. Nothing has,\nfor a while now; Ever since he turned cold.",

At best\nhe is a tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe and\nnot make messes in the house.  \u2013 Lazarus Long, Time Enough for\nLove\n\n\nYou probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you\ncould know how seldom they do. \u2013 Olin Miller\n\n\nIf you judge people, you have no time to love them. \u2013 Mother Teresa\n\n\nFeeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present\nand not giving it. \u2013 William Arthur Ward\n\n\n\nWhere the mind is without fear and the head held high;\nWhere knowledge is free;\nWhere the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;\nWhere words come out from the depth of truth;\nWhere tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;\nWhere the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;\nWhere the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action;\nInto that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.\n\n\nRabindranath Tagore \u2013 Let My Country Awake\n\n\n\nThe true Enlightenment thinker, the true rationalist, never wants to\ntalk anyone into anything. No, he does not even want to convince;\nall the time he is aware that he may be wrong. Above all, he values\nthe intellectual independence of others too highly to want to\nconvince them in important matters. He would much rather invite\ncontradiction, preferably in the form of rational and disciplined\ncriticism. He seeks not to convince but to arouse \u2014 to challenge\nothers to form free opinions. \u2013 Karl Popper \u2013 On Freedom\n\n\nDon't ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you\ncome alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is\npeople who have come alive. \u2013 Howard Thurman\n\n\nAll you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't\nhurt. \u2013 Charles M Schultz",

      "text": "About 20 of us, gathered at Andheri Station, to leave for Surat.\nI was the only one playing in his/her first tournament, and it was\nexciting to be a part of a squad, going to a tournament.  A first\nin my life.  We had two teams, A and B, or better known as Storm\nand Chasers.  I was playing for the Chasers team.  The train\njourney was pretty uneventful for me, unfortunately so, because of\na mixed up ticket booking and only 4 of us, sitting in the AC\ncoach.  I ended up reading or sleeping for most part of the\njourney.  I didn't realize, we could just walk into the other\ncoach where most of the others were having a lot of fun!\n\n\n\nFountainhead School was the venue for the tournament, and they\nhad arranged for transport, accommodation and food and drinks,\nall through the tournament.  The organization for the tournament\nwas pretty good, I must say!  We had a bus pick us up at the\nrailway station, and getting into the bus felt like we were some\nbig team with our own team bus, and stuff (though, there was also\nthe Silent Voice team on the bus ;).  Ganesh and I had a little\nchat in the bus, and he was recollecting his experiences in his\nfirst tournament, and was asking me what I expected from the\ntournament, and I didn't really have a good answer, because I was\ntoo excited.  But, I really enjoyed the chat with him.\n\n\n\nWe all crashed at the school library for the night, for a hard day\nin the field on the next day.  We rushed to the field, early next\nmorning, about half a km of walk from the school, the playing\nfield was in the middle of some fields and we warmed up to a\nlovely sun rise.  Storm had their first game at 7, against Dream\nCatchers, and they started a little rusty in the first half, but\ncame back strongly in the second one to beat them 11-7.  This was\ngoing to be closest their opposition was going to come to winning!\nChasers had their first game against Silent Voice, a team from\nAhmedabad.  We got together as a team for the first time, really,\nand having just one substitute player didn't really help much.  We\ngot thrashed by Silent voice, 11-4 or 11-5.  Chasers got the next\ngame as a bye, since Lay Lapak failed to turn up for the\ntournament and this meant we slid up the table and got to play the\nDream Catchers from Ahmedabad.  Craig reached in time, from\nMumbai, for this game, and we gave them a decent fight in this\ngame, though the score line didn't really suggest it.  We were\ndoing way too many mistakes (and repeating them!) near the\nend-zones and they were costing us a lot.  The highlight of these\ngames, though, was the spectacular layouts by Cheerag on D. Storm,\nmeanwhile, thrashed the HAT team 11-0, and beat Surat Trailblazers\nconvincingly.\n\n\n\nA lot of the teams had school kids on them, who were playing\nastonishingly well.  The pick out of those was Jumbish, which had\n10 to 15 year olds, jumping all over the place and giving their\nopposition a run for their money.  The moment of the tournament\nfor me was a catch by a Jumbish player, who jumped ahead of him,\nto take a catch, flipped over in the air without placing his hands\non to the ground, and landed on his feet and made a perfectly nice\npass to his team-mate!  Exciting stuff to watch!  Pune also has a\nnice Ultimate program for kids, and their team Royal Spirits was\nplaying some good Ultimate.\n\n\n\nThe last game of the day was Storm vs. Flying Spirits from Pune,\nwho were second on the points table, after Storm.  But Storm was\nclinical in their execution, and \"Bagel-ed\" [read as, thrashed\n11-0] Flying Spirits.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, we had a good dinner and lots of ice-cream\nand discussed our favorite moments of the day.  I felt proud to\nhave featured in atleast one person's favorite moments, in my\nfirst tournament! W00t!  Some of us fooled around on the dance\nfloor for a while, to some Gujarati and Bollywood music.\n\n\n\nThe next day started with us playing Royal Spirits (Pune).  We\nstarted off strongly, but ended up giving away some easy scores\ntowards the end of the game, and ended up drawing the game at 6\nall.  Our next game against Storm was another Bagel for Storm.\nThey played zone on us, and though we were as patient as we could\nbe, we simply didn't have enough skill and team work to score\nagainst them.  Our next game against Flying Spirits was a very\ngood game, and I'd rate it the best amongst our games.  We played\na good stack and played hard on D, and were able to keep the\nscores at 5-5 until the last 5 minutes, when they scored and\nfinished winners.  The Flying Spirits admitted to us giving them a\ngood competition and making them work hard for their goals.  Our\nlast game was against Zero Gravity, a team from the school\nitself, and our first victory!  We started off pretty strongly,\nand were able to finish the game 10-5.\n\n\n\nThe final between Storm and Cats-Dogs (Delhi) was so much fun to\nwatch.  Storm stuck to their clinical performance and everyone\nseemed to be playing at their best!  They came out winners 13-4\nin a game that lasted close to an hour and a half.  All the other\ngames, btw, were games-to-11 and time capped to 55 minutes.\nStorm also managed to win the Spirit award for the tournament,\nand it is the first time in Indian Ultimate's history that a team\nwon both the tournament and the spirit award!\n\n\n\nThe tournament was a lot of fun and a lot of learning for me.  I\nlearnt a lot of things from everyone playing there, specially from\nthe players in Storm.  I know I'll carry forward some wonderful\nmemories from my first tournament, thanks to everyone from Storm\nChasers and everybody else, who I played against.  I really liked\nthe idea of spirit circles after the games, where each team\ndiscussed the game and appreciated the other team about particular\naspects of their team and play and suggested areas that they could\nwork on, to improve themselves.  I also hung out around some of\nthe spirit circles of Storm and their opposition and I really\nloved listening to Apu speak to the opposition.  On almost every\noccasion, it gave me goosebumps!  Thanks Apu, for showing us, what\nthe spirit of the game should mean to each of us.  Ganesh\nmentioned, in the chat we had on the bus to the school, that I'd\nlearn a lot more than just Ultimate, and it turned out to be true.\nI got to learn a lot about my team, and everybody on Storm\nchasers.  I experienced what it feels like, to be a part of a\nsquad or a team, for the first time and it feels great, in short!\nThanks Ganesh for the chat, and all the inspiration on-and-off the\nfield.  In the middle of one of the games, Willis walked up to me\nand told me to be more confident on the field and move more\ncrisply on the field.  I'm not sure, that will change in one game,\nbut that is something I'll remember for a long time to come.\nKayleigh reminded me of one of the good catches I took on day-1,\nby having it in her favorite moments of the day.  As someone\nplaying in his first tournament, that's a pretty big deal!  Thanks\nto Willis and Kayleigh for all the encouragement, guidance and\ntraining!  Thanks to Parag for drilling it into our team, that we\nare going to keep the game's tempo high, but our tempers low.  The\ntournament was much more fun, that way.  Thanks to Robo for giving\nme the cleats, and the encouragement during many a practice\nsession.  Thanks to Rose for being the wonderful captain that she\nwas, thanks to Cheerag for showing us how much one can give on D,\nthanks to Craig, Diti, Rakesh, Sheryll and Vishal for being\nsupportive and being patient with me and all my blunders.  Thanks\nto Pixie for all the morning practice sessions, while we were\nwaiting for everyone else to turn up.  Thanks to Mak for help from\nthe shouting helping me out from the side lines.  Thanks to Jimmy,\nMegna, and Sarah, for making me feel a part of the squad, and for\nbeing a part of the wonderful Storm!  Here are some pictures,\nthanks to Shantanu and Saurabh, who traveled all the way to Surat\nto watch, cheer and capture!\n\n\n\nEven if, our team won just one out of the 6 games we played, it\nwas an Ultimate tourney.  Literally!  Looking forward to future\ntournaments.",

      "text": "Disclaimer: All characters appearing in this work are divine.  Any\nresemblance to real or divine persons, living or dead, is purely\nintentional.\n\n\n\nA few days back, a couple of friends and I were discussing, how\nanything sells in India and how opening a restaurant is seemingly\nan easy way to make some quick bucks.  But, now, I have a much\nbetter plan to make some big money, may be not so quickly, but\ndefinitely a lot more \u2013 at least by an order of magnitude.\n\n\n\nReligion!  Nothing sells like it, in the land of snake charmers!\nPeople will buy anything on offer.  This post gives the recipe for\nturning a small temple in a god forsaken town, into a big place\nof worship that \"attracts\" devotees from all over the country, if\nnot the world!\n\n\n\nThe first task would be to zero-in on a temple.  But before that,\nlet's define the kind of town we are interested in.  Ideally, the\ntown should be within a couple of hundred kilometers away from a\ncity with good transport connectivity and a population at around\none and a half million (There are about 20 such cities, in the\ncountry).  The temple in question could piggy back on the fame of\na temple nearby, if it is within about 50 kilometers of a really\nfamous temple, but in that case, our temple would remain the\nsecond preference, for a very long time to come.  But this is much\neasier to accomplish and arguably a quicker buck.  Ideally,\nthough, we'd prefer a location, which doesn't have any other\nfamous temples in the radius of about 300 kms (roughly 5-6 hours\nby road).  It also helps if the travel to the temple for the big\ncity is through the country side, giving a glimpse of the country\nside that urban Indians can only dream of connecting, the life\nthat was once lived by their parents and grandparents, but they\nnow only get to see in the movies.  This will help us score some\npoints with the \"educated and sophisticated\" urban populace.\n\n\n\nNow, the temple.  It should be the biggest or the only one in\ntown, though having smaller temples around helps in knitting more\ntales around the temple.  The temple in question should be one,\nthat the locals have tremendous faith in.  You should be able to\nfind at least a dozen people who vouch for the miraculous power of\nthe gods in there, without trying too hard.  That should be good\nenough, to get you going, and I believe this isn't too hard for\nany random temple, anywhere in the country.\n\n\n\nThe gods.  It really doesn't matter who the god is.  He/she could\neither be a generalist or a specialist and that would influence\nthe type of crowds coming in.  Your god can be as specialized as\nyou like, up to the extent of specializing in blessing people get\nvisas to the US.  Now, your god can either be an already well\nknown god, or a not so well known incarnation of a well known god,\nor a new person who is soon to become god!  The first type is a\nhard bet; the third option is somewhat high risk too, and you'll\nreally need to put your mind to it, to make it work.  The second\noption is the easiest one.  It always helps to have some real\nobjects and places that can be associated with the god, and are\nliving proof that the god once lived here and used those things.\nIt really helps if you can give the devotees the feeling that they\nare doing all the things that the god in question once used to do,\nat the same places he/she used to do it.  Type-3 gods would work\nwell for this.\n\n\n\nSpread the word.  This, obviously, is the most important part and\nthe hardest one too.  It's best to start with the word of mouth.\nStart with family and friends and friends of friends and friends\nof friends of friends (read as facebook-only-friends).  Pick the\nmore religious of the lot, encourage them to visit the place,\nwrite and share blog posts/tweets/pictures/tales/stories and\nwhatever else, with them.  Encourage them to interact with the\nlocals.  I don't think it would be necessary to make any deals\nwith the locals.  They are smart enough, wherever you go!  You\nneed to actively market your god, until a critical mass of happy\ndevotees, has been reached.  A critical mass is reached, when\nthere are more people talking of their wishes coming true, than\nthere are people who are still waiting for their wishes to come\ntrue.  This should be too hard given that, religious people tend\nto believe that whatever happens, happens for the best and god has\nbetter plans for them, than their own.  Slowly, you could coax one\nof the better writers (who is also religious?) into writing a book\nor two about your temple.  A couple of years after selling your\nbook, you should try and encourage one of the big TV houses to\nmake a teleserial based on the book, and that would be it!  Now,\nyou can sit back and relax.\n\n\n\nWhile getting all of the above right is important, it is also\nsuper important to work out things with the current priest, form a\ntemple trust, and manage other such things and to time all of it\nperfectly.  This part of the plan is left as an exercise for the\nreader.\n\n\n\nOn the whole, this is a much more fruitful exercise than setting\nup a restaurant, since this helps a whole economy grow around the\ntemple.  A whole bunch of things crop up, near our small town.\nTransportation grows by leaps and bounds, hospitals and schools\ngrow with the population, the local vendors start earning more and\nget a better quality of life, and all that jazz.  I guess, you get\nthe drift.",

      "text": "Why this article?\n\n\nI teach (Science and Engineering) students and teachers to use\nPython for their computational tasks.  I'm occasionally asked\nthis question or something similar.  I remember, it was not too\nlong ago, that I asked this question very often.  I asked\nanybody who was more experienced than me, \"How do I start\ncontributing (code) to FOSS?\" and all the answers I got, were\nvery similar.  Also, my answer is not going to be radically\ndifferent.  But, I would still like to answer this question,\nbecause -\n\n\n\n\nAll the answers I got, were from big-time, experienced\ncontributors.  I suspect, they only vaguely remember how it feels\nto be just starting off.  But, I am just starting off and I think\nmy answer brings a slightly different perspective that would help\nothers1.\n\nThis piece of writing is meant to be one comprehensive\ncompilation of things I want to share, if and when I'm asked\nthis question in the future2.\n\nMore than anything else, a reminder and reference for myself.  I\nstill have a long way to go.  I only have a handful of\ncontributions against my name (none of them earth shattering).  I\nhaven't (yet) done my 10,000 hours of programming nor have I\nlearned anything like half a dozen programming\nlanguages.3\n\n\n\n\nThanks to baali, Ringo and Voodoo for reading drafts of this\narticle and giving some very valuable feedback to improve\nit.\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n\nI know how exciting the FOSS world seems, the first time we discover\nit.  You are dying to contribute.  You want to contribute, Right\nNow!  But you've no clue, what, where and how.  Relax.  Give\nyourself time.  You've a lifetime ahead of you.  Explore.  Explore,\neven more.  Play with things, Try out stuff, Break stuff, Spill\nthings all over the place.  Have fun!4\n\n\n\nGiven that you are reading this, I presume that, you do have access\nto the Internet.  But, if you don't, it could turn an impediment to\nyour goal.  Easy access to a decent internet connection is a\nprerequisite.\n\n\n\nLearn a programming language, well3.  By learning, I don't\nmean getting familiar with the syntax or passing a bunch of exams.\nGet familiar with the paradigms of the language.  Learn to think in\nthat language.  Write code that does something real, instead of\ndoing toy examples.5  Also, it helps know bits and pieces about the\nhistory and evolution of the language.  This will give you a sense\nof why some features are present (or absent) and will help you\nprogram better, in that language6.\n\n\n\nSome projects will definitely catch your eye, while you are\nexploring.  Start using the ones that you need.  Follow them!\n\n\n\nStart with using the bleeding edge 7 software.  Bleeding edge\nrefers to the latest sources of the project, where the active\ndevelopment is going on.  Given the continuous nature of software\ndevelopment, using the latest source,\n\n\nprevents you from wasting time on fixing bugs that have already\n\n\n\nbeen fixed and\n\n\nlets you look at the latest changes being made and contribute\n\n\n\neffectively and easily\n Also, start following the project mailing lists \u2013 both the dev and\n the user lists, if they are separate.  The user-list discussions\n will help you discover functionality and possibly give you some\n chance to peek at the source code, too.  Don't be surprised or\n worried if you don't follow most of what goes on, in the dev-list.\n Be patient and keep at it.  You will learn a lot about the what,\n why and how of the project.  Also don't be afraid to look foolish\n there!  There wouldn't be one developer who doesn't have some\n embarrassing logs of stuff she said in public, in her initial days.\n\n\n\nSlowly you'll start to learn the dynamics of the community \u2013 how\nthings function, the DOs and DON'Ts, etc 8.  Also, there's\na good chance that the project has an active IRC channel.  If it\ndoes, hanging out there will give you more insights.  Contributing\nto the documentation, is often a useful step before contributing\ncode.  Cleaning up the documentation or writing documentation, often\nrequires you to read the code and helps you understand it better.\n\n\n\nNext, start acting on Bug reports (or tiny feature requests).\nStart with trying to reproduce the bugs and sending confirmations.\nGradually, start looking at the source and trying to figure out\nwhere the problem is.  Be patient, with this 9 .  Once\nyou get comfortable with the code and the coding style, start\nsending code snippets and comments, explaining what you think might\nbe the problem.  One fine day, you will be able to send a full\nworking patch!  But, before that don't hesitate to send partial\nfixes.  You can learn a lot from the comments of the devs and\nlooking at how they finally fixed it.  Also, IRC could be a good\nplace to ask for help, if you are stuck and are looking for some\nquick help, so you can move further.\n\n\n\nIn all of this, it helps if you have one (or a bunch of) favorite\narea(s) or module(s) of the project, specially in a big project.\nYou should pounce upon any issues in your favorite area.\n\n\n\nParticipate in sprints.  It's not uncommon for projects to have\nregular sprints.  Make it there 10!  Also, a couple of\ndevelopers may decide to meet up on a weekend and hack.  If it's\nhappening in your neighborhood, ask if you can join.  Don't be\nsurprised, if they shout out a big YES!  You will definitely learn a\nlot, when there is help so close-by.\n\n\n\nA shortcut would be to start your own project!  It is easier (in\nsome ways) to release your own code under a FOSS license, than\ncontribute to some of the existing projects.  You don't have to have\nyour code approved by the project leads, you don't need to mould\nyour code to fit the standards of the project, you don't have to\nread and understand all the (relevant parts of the) existing code,\netc.  But all of this, definitely teaches you a lot.\n\n\n\nAs a beginner, I think it is important to solve your own problems,\nproblems that you care about (at least at that point in time).  Most\nof the projects, started off with their developers wanting to solve\ntheir own problems.  Only, incidentally, they solved some of the\nWorld's problems, too!\n\n\n\nStart small, though.  Don't start off with a project that aims to\nreplace Chrome or Firefox as the best browser, or an editor to\nreplace Vim or Emacs.  Writing extensions to your favorite software\ncould be a good place to start, for instance an Emacs minor/major\nmode11, a Chrome extension12, etc.  Stand on the shoulders\nof giants!\n\n\n\nAlso, take this as an opportunity to gain some of the skills that\nwould be useful, when you want to start contributing to others\nprojects.\n\n\n\nLearn to use Version Control (Git + GitHub is awesome!)\n\nLearn to use build and setup tools.\n\nLearn about packaging and distributing your software.\n\nLearn how to license your code.\n\nLearn to Collaborate!\n\n\n\n\nAll of this, I hope, would suffice to get your first contribution\nin.  But, there are a few things that will help you in the long run.\n\n\n\nGood English. Specially written communication, since that is how you\nwould be communicating, more often than not.  Fair or not, hackers\nare known to be very particular about good communication.  I'm not\nexaggerating when I say, what you say may be ignored even if it\nmakes perfect sense, if you said it in sloppy English.\n\n\n\nUsing a *nix would put you in some great company.  At the very\nleast, you save time when looking for solutions to known problems.\nUsing a good editor and learning to type quickly can be big\nproductivity gains.  You only get 24 hours a day!\n\n\n\nAn understanding of licensing issues, can come in handy, many a\ntimes.\n\n\n\nFor more, read How to Become a Hacker by Eric Raymond.\n\n\n\nHappy Hacking!\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes: \n\n\n1 \nI'm writing in the Indian context.\n\n\n2 \nAll of this is generic advice, but students applying to\nprograms like GSoC, may find it useful.\n\n\n3 \nTeach Yourself Programming in Ten Years by Peter Norvig.\n\n\n4 \nGetting yourself a GitHub account and socializing there\nis a lot of fun and helps quite a bit.  GitHub is my Facebook!\n\n\n5 \nI started learning Python from the Python tutorial and some\nother sources and doing the examples in them.  It was good, but I\nthink I started learning more, and better, when I started solving\nproblems from Project Euler.  And writing an IRC bot in Python, taught\nme a lot more than all of this.\n\n\n6 \nI recommend Python, but I am definitely biased.  Any\nlanguage that is generic enough would do, really.\n\n\nIt gets you off the blocks, very quickly.\n\nIt is easy to learn.\n\nIt is batteries included. Read as, comes bundled with a huge bunch of libraries.\n\nIt is general purpose enough. Read as, it has libraries that let you do anything, you'd possibly want to do.\n\nThere's a lot of Python code around, that you can read and\n\n\n\nlearn from.\n\n\n7 \nYou may have to learn to use a version control system; at the\nvery least cloning and pulling updates.\n\n\n8 \nOrg-mode is the only project that I really contribute to,\nactively.  I really liked the way the community gels together and\nthe kind of people on the list.  There are some really knowledgeable,\nfriendly and helpful people.  It feels great to be a part of the\ncommunity.\n\n\n9 \nThere have been instances, where it took me half a day\nto fix something, that would've been fixed in about an hour by someone\nmore comfortable with the code.  But, I think everybody goes through\nthis stage.  This is how you learn.\n\n\n10 \nA few months ago, I was part of a sprint on the numpy-scipy\neco-system.  We had somewhere around 50 patches (a lot of them were\ndocumentation fixes) submitted to all the projects!  Most of the\npeople were submitting their first patch and I think it was a great\nopportunity for them to start.  [I should try and get back to them.]\n\n\n11 \nOrg-mode is really awesome, and I use it for everything I\nwrite.  Blog posts are a big part of what I write, and so, I wanted to\nwrite them in orgmode.  And so, org2blog was born.\n\n\n12 \nI recently wrote a Chrome extension, thanks to a friend's\nidea.  Inspired by Gmail notifications, a GitHub addict wanted\nnotifications for activity in GitHub.",

I couldn't justify, to myself, paying the initial\none-time verification fee that Google asks for.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: [2011-03-04 Fri] Added GetHub to the store\n\n\n\n\nComments and Feedback\n\n\nFeel free to write to me at punchagan+gethub@jeemail.com\n\nOr file issues at GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy GitHubbing!",

Tehom, the author of\nthe other package got in touch with me, and we tried to clean up a\nfew things.  In this process, we decided to use two different\nnamespaces, to avoid conflicts if a particular user has both the\npackages loaded.  I am going to use org2blog/wp as my namespace\nprefix, instead of the older org2blog.  So, if you are posting a\nsub-tree, you'll need to use the org2blog/wp-post-subtree\nfunction, instead of org2blog-post-subtree.\n\n\n\nWe, Tehom and I, did discuss the possibility of merging the two\npackages into a single huge package, but we think the amount of\nwork is far greater than the payoffs.  So, the packages continue\nto be called org2blog but we reference each others packages, to\nreduce the confusion, amongst users.\n\n\n\norg2blog/wp version 0.4 comes with the new namespace.",

      "text": "This is some fun I had, trying to replicate what was written in\nthis post. I had been trying to understand what was happening\nhere, and found this post on Hacker News very helpful.\n\n\n\nIt is a known fact that our eyes have more cones for green and\nred as compared to blue.  The Bayer filter used for digital camera\nlenses is based upon this principle.  This post tries to\nillustrate that using the following two arguments.\n\n\nLooking at only the blue channel of an image looks very dark.\n\nTripling the pixel size of blue channel doesn't cause much\ndistortion in the final image.\n\n\n\nHence, our eyes suck at blue.\n\n\n\nTheir argument is flawed, but we could try and improve a few\nthings.\n\n\n\nLooking at the blue channel.\n\n\nThis is definitely flawed, since the intensity of blue in the\nimage they have taken may be less and hence giving us a false\npositive.\n\n\n\nWe could instead gray-scale the image and use these pixel values\nin the 3 channels and look at the images.\n\n\n\nThis also eliminates the problem of the image being captured\nthrough a Bayer filter.\n\n\n\nHere's some python code to do the same. (uses matplotlib)\n\n\n\ndef show_channels(I):\n    for i in range(3):\n\tJ = zeros_like(I)\n\tJ[:, :, i] = I[:, :, i]\n\tfigure(i)\n\timshow(J)\n\ndef show_grey_channels(I):\n    K = average(I, axis=2)\n    for i in range(3):\n\tJ = zeros_like(I)\n\tJ[:, :, i] = K\n\tfigure(i+10)\n\timshow(J)\n\n\n\n\n\nPixelating the blue channel\n\n\nAgain, there was this argument of use of Bayer filter affecting\nthe image and the like.\n\n\n\nWhat I did was to swap the channels, and then look at the\nimages. However I swapped the channels, the image where the\ngreen channel was pixelated always looked the worst.  The\ndifference between blue and red was less noticeable, I feel.\n\n\n\nHere's the code.\n\n\n\n\ndef zoom(x, factor=2):\n    rows, cols = x.shape\n    row_stride, col_stride = x.strides\n    view = np.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided(x,\n\t\t\t(rows, factor, cols, factor),\n\t\t\t(row_stride, 0, col_stride, 0))\n    return view.reshape((rows*factor, cols*factor))\n\ndef subsample(I):\n    for i in range(3):\n\tJ = I.copy()\n\tJ[:, :, i] = zoom(I[::4, ::4, i], 4)\n\tfigure(i)\n\ttitle(\"%s channel subsampled\" %colors[i])\n\timshow(J)\n\ndef swap_subsample(I, k=1):\n    for c, color in enumerate(colors):\n\tprint \"%s <-- %s\" %(colors[c], colors[(c+k)%3])\n    for i in range(3):\n\tJ = zeros_like(I)\n\tfor j in range(3):\n\t    J[:, :, j] = I[:, :, (j+k)%3]\n\tJ[:, :, i] = zoom(I[::4, ::4, (i+k)%3], 4)\n\tfigure(i+10)\n\ttitle(\"%s channel subsampled\" %colors[i])\n\timshow(J)\n\n\n\n\n\nImages\n\n\nHere are a few images.

      "text": "Hello World!\n\n\n\nMy first post at my new home.  Obviously, it was going to be about the\nmove.  You knew it, didn't you? ;)\n\n\n\nWell, I got some space on the web, along with a few friends.  Thanks to\nmy org-mode fanboyism, I now use it to maintain my homepage.  I've\nsuccessfully completed import of my Wordpress posts and comments. :)\n\n\n\nI now use\n\n\nEmacs and Org-mode 1 to write my posts.\n\norg-hyde.el 2 to publish html in a hyde\nparse-able format.\n\nhyde 3 to convert the html pages into a blog.\n\norg-publish to publish other pages in my home page.\n\ngit 4 and a bash script for publishing.\n\nDisqus 5 for the comment system.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, I know it sounds rather complicated. :) But, now that I\nhave it set up, it's not all that difficult to make a post.\nIt's just a matter of one git commit and push.  I need to\nfine-tune the shell script a bit, though.\n\n\n\n\nHow I moved\n\n\nThe move definitely wasn't trivial.  I guess, I could've started\nafresh but, what fun would that have been? ;)\n\n\n\nThis roughly how I did things \u2013 in the order that I did them.\n\n\n\n\nChoosing hyde\n\n\nI looked at a handful of options to maintain a blog, using\norg-mode \u2014 blorg, org-jekyll, blorgit, ikiwiki.\nAfter some assessment, I decided upon org-jekyll and\njekyll.  But then, I accidentally stumbled upon hyde.\n\n\n\nI decided to go with hyde instead of jekyll 6\nsince\n\n\n\nIt's in Python.  I didn't want to start figuring out Ruby,\nnow.\n\nIt uses Django templates 7.  And Django is\nsomething, I wish to learn.  I've started with that. :)\n\n\n\n\n\nClean up org-jekyll to work with hyde.\n\n\nI then \"ported\" org-jekyll.el into org-hyde.el.\n\n\n\nremoved stuff like categories and languages, that I was not\ngoing to use.\n\nAdded some code w.r.t timestamps, from org2blog, to it, so\nthat my older org2blog posts could be easily ported.\n\n\n\n\n\nClean up older org2blog posts\n\n\norg2blog can post either buffers or subtrees.  I had posts in\nboth formats.  I converted all of them into subtrees of one\ntree, using some Python.\n\n\n\n\nImport older posts\n\n\nThis was the most painful posts.  Importing all the old posts\nfrom Wordpress.  org-mode really needs a XHTML/XML importer!\n\n\n\nI did all sorts of crazy stuff to get this done.\n\n\n\nused pandoc to convert html to markdown\n\nwrote some throw away regex code to convert markdown to\n      org-mode.\n\nwrote more regex code to convert html to org-mode.\n\nhacked up a lot of stuff and finally got all the posts into\n      org format! :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA workflow for publishing\n\n\nSet up git along with some bash code, to have a mechanism\nto minimize the effort in making a blog post.  All this is\nstill a lot of work, compared to the ease with which I used to\nuse org2blog.  That's partly due to ssh restrictions in my\nhostel.\n\n\n\n\nCSS clean-up\n\n\nI'm using the same CSS for org-mode published files and\nhyde published files. I had to clean up my hyde templates\nand the CSS to make both of them look similar.\n\n\n\nMy first tryst with CSS hasn't been all that bad. :)\n\n\n\n\nInstalling disqus and importing comments\n\n\nUsing disqus was one thing, I wasn't sure I wanted to do.  I\nwould've loved it if comments could be managed with org-mode\ntoo. ;) 8\n\n\n\nAnyway, I finally decided to go with it, and I'm quite happy\nwith it. :)\n\n\n\nI loved the ease with which comments could be imported.\n\n\n\nImport Wordpress comments using the export xml file.\n\nGenerate a CSV file containing the URL map \u2013 mapping the\nnewer urls to the older ones.\n\nUpload the CSV file and tada!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nI got to learn quite a few things, during all of this.  I also\nhave some bits of code, that I can share with you, in case you\nare interested.  Leave a comment, if you wish. :)\n\n\n\nI'm just hoping to reduce the additional steps required in\npublishing to ensure it doesn't add to my already erratic\nblogging habits.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes: \n\n\n1 \nOrg-mode - Homepage\n\n\n2 \nOrg-hyde is a port of org-jekyll.el\n\n\n3 \nHyde - Github\n\n\n4 \nGit - Homepage\n\n\n5 \nDisqus - Homepage\n\n\n6 \nGithub - Jekyll\n\n\n7 \nDocumentation - Django Templates\n\n\n8 \nI feel it is capable of doing that.

My post\non this month's Bloggerstock topic will appear at That Ain't Kosher.\n\n\n\nAnd here is Dominick's post for you\n\n\n\n\nHello world..today I'll be talking about a period in time I would like\nto do-over, however I couldn't think of anything so I went in another\ndirection\u2026.I'd like to thank Bloggerstock and punchagan for\nthe opportunity leak my thoughts on this page\u2026.\n\n\n\nI hope the readers understand that my views does not reflect those of\nthe host's page..before I get started though Let me take the time out\nto explain what Bloggerstock is all about.  Bloggerstock is the\nbrainchild of a small group of bloggers who connected on 20SB. The\nidea comes from the concept of a blog-swap in that maybe we could\ncreate our own kind of event where we all wrote posts to be posted on\nthe next person\u2019s blog. Essentially forming a blog-ring.\n\n\n\nThere's a lot of things in life everyone would like to relive and do\ndifferently..I've been giving it some thought and it's been racking my\nbrain for the whole month now\u2026I came to the conclusion that I have\nnothing I'd like to really do-over\u2026\n\n\n\nMy reason for this is that I wouldn't be this person I am\u2026and I\nwouldn't alter it in anyway\u2026I love what I've become\u2026if it weren't\nfor all the good and bad that occurred during my life time..I wouldn't\neven be here writing this\u2026.or I wouldn't even have the same goals\nand all my aspirations would be small\u2026I know this all sounds weird\nbut giving the fact that I am a weird person, those who know me, this\nis expected\u2026I believe in things happening for a reason and without\nthese occurrences we'd be something totally different, and\n\n\n\nmaybe not becoming what we're suppose to be in life\u2026sometimes we\nlook at situations and think, \" Just maybe if I had done this\u2026 or\nmaybe if I hadn't\u2026\" even if my decisions had made into a bum on the\nstreets I think I would feel the same way\u2026truth is we all have\nregrets..learning to live with them is the hardest thing to do..we\ntend to get caught up in the moment and want to relive those\nthings..either for the good or the bad\u2026but we fail to realize that\nit is those things that build character not for today but for our\ntomorrows.\n\n\n\nWhether it's falling for the wrong person, being back stabbed from a\nfriend, getting hoodwinked from a stranger, or missing out on an\nopportunity\u2026.all of these are just life's lessons being taught..with\nthat being said you should never sulk over a decision we've made\u2026in\nthe end we're our own cause of grief or happiness so don't whine about\nit stuff that's happened\u2026.accept what has happened and move\nforward\u2026don't hold on to them, but don't forget them either\u2026these\nare turning points in our lives so appreciate them..\n\n\n\nWell that's all I have to conjure up on the matter..though it kind of\nwent against the topic a bit but hey am stubborn lol.. once again I'd\nlike to thank punchagan for allowing me to feature on Rustic\nReverie and also Bloggerstock for providing me with the opportunity to\nexpress myself on a fellow blogger's page.. here's a link to my page\nto view my featured blog post",

His simple recommendation was to use Python\nif we saw any opportunity where it could be used, without\nbothering about permissions, convincing people etc.  \"It's better\nto ask for forgiveness, than for permission.\"  He spoke of myths\naround Python \u2013 scripting language, dynamic language, too much\nwhite space, toy language, nobody uses it.  He concluded the talk,\nby saying mentioning Indian driving to be an indication of some\nquick reflexes that we Indians have. ;) On the whole it was an\nenlightening, humorous and enjoyable talk.\n\n\n\nI didn't attend too many of other talks.  Amongst the ones that I\ndid attend, I particularly liked the one by Asim Mittal on using\nthe Nintendo Wii with Python.\n\n\n\nOn some thought about my experiences at conferences, I think\nconferences shouldn't have any talks at all.

Yo!\n\n\n\nThe Route map\n\n\nIIT-Bombay to Karnala Bird Sanctuary, and back.\n\n\n\n\nUp\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nThe Story\n\n\nWe started at around 0720 and were hoping to reach Karnala Bird\nSanctuary by around 1130.  We \u2014 actually, soot covered clones of\nus \u2014  reached by about 1215 or so.  That's pretty decent,\nconsidering we were directed to Karnala sports complex, when we were\nlooking for bird sanctuary and there was quite a bit of traffic near\nPanvel.\n\n\n\nWhile we were getting tickets to get into the sanctuary, a man was\namused by Ritesh's polka (dirt) dotted shirt and asks us whether we\nrode down from JNPT.  We got all excited and told him, that we rode\ndown from Powai!  He just said, \"Gone Mad!\" and walked away, as if\nmadness was contagious.  Both of us, felt great!  We were high!  It\nfelt like the best compliment to get after a long, tiring,\n(blackening) ride.  We got in and rushed to a tap and almost had a\nbath under it.  The first touch of cold water was heaven!  Just a\nwhile later, we got a shock.  We couldn't get any food near/inside\nthe sanctuary.  We will have to go back 3 km for that.  We spent\nabout an hour and a half, getting some oxygen, looking for a few\nbirds, giving up and settling with spiders and clicking some\npictures.  We got went back 3km to the hotel and spent about an hour\nthere (not all of it eating ;). We started back at around 1515.\n\n\n\nThe ride back was eventful.  We took a slightly different route,\ntempted by a free Highway(NH4), waiting to be rode on.  The road\nlooked awesome, with a hill on the left, and no vehicles in sight.\nBut, as fate would have it, Ritesh's rear tyre gave way.  After some\nsearch we found a guy fixing tyres of vehicles on the highway.  But\nhe refused to fix our bicycle.  He refused even to fill air in it,\nso we could reach the nearest cycle repair shop.  After more search,\nwe found who agreed to fill air in the tyre. (It needs a special\nvalve pin.  The previous guy, probably didn't have it. But we\ncould've hacked up something.)\n\n\n\nWe rushed to Kalamboli and got the tyre fixed.  Then we headed back\nin the route that we had come on.  It'd been raining on and off\nthrough out the morning.  But first rain on the return only started\nnear Nerul.  It was a great relief.  My cycle started moving more\nsmoothly\u2026  I loved it.  We got lost a bit near Ghatkopar.  Also,\nthe traffic was quite bad there. (Why do drivers get so bad, once it\nstarts raining?  It's not unique to Mumbai, but quite visible here.\nWe were back in Campus by around 2040.\n\n\n\nRitesh was energized after the puncture was fixed.  He rode like\ncrazy, after that.  The sole of my feet started hurting \u2014\nsomething like a cramp.  I don't know what exactly happened.  Also,\nmy groin was hurting quite a bit.

(We drank about 7L of water between us)\n\nNeed to learn how to fix punctures.  Need a tool kit.\n\nA helmet, shorts with padding would be good.\n\nAn odometer would be useful too.\n\nLearn to use the hand-pump or carry along a normal pump.\n\nI should probably ride along with some Cycling group for the\nexperience of it.

We had to get down\nfrom the auto, and after a lot of fight, the auto got on top.\nAs the driver was trying hard to get the auto moving, a guy\ncomes over and starts talking to him in Marathi.

The actual\nthread is here.\n\n\n\n\nThe way that I learned how to program in emacs lisp was mainly\nusing two commands `elisp-index-search' bound to `C-h e' on my\nsystem, and most importantly `describe-function' bound to `C-h f'.\nWith `describe-function' you can look at the source code of\nfunctions whose behavior you are familiar with, you can then copy\nportions of the code to your scratch buffer where they can be\nedited and evaluated with `eval-defun' bound to `C-M-x'.  Now with\nBabel, instead of doing this in the scratch buffer you could do\nthis in emacs-lisp code blocks in an org file, enabling notes and\nhierarchical organization \u2013 it can be nice to have your noodling\nall collected in one file for later reference.\n\n\n\nIf you are going to do any serious work with lisp, I would\nemphatically recommend using paredit-mode, and becoming friends\nwith the Sexp movement functions\n\n\n\nC-M-f        runs the command paredit-forward\nC-M-b        runs the command paredit-backward\nC-M-u        runs the command backward-up-list\nC-M-k        runs the command kill-sexp\nC-y        runs the command yank\n\n\n\nThey allow you to manipulate lisp code on the level of logical\nexpressions, the utility of which can not be over stated.\n\n\n\nAs for working with Org-mode in particular, I'd recommend looking\nat the documentation and source-code of Org-mode functions with\n`describe-function', and then looking for how these functions are\nactually used in the Org-mode code base with `rgrep'.\n\n\n\nFor a more structured learning experience, I've heard very good\nthings about http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/,\nalthough I haven't used it myself.\n\n\n\nHope this helps.

In order to cater to an\nIndian audience and scenario, this version has been tweaked\nslightly. Sage Days 25 has beginner level tutorials, in addition to\nthe usual talks and sprints, to help new users get started with Sage\nand help promote the use of Sage in India.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Sage?\n\n\nSage is a free, open-source mathematics software system licensed under\nthe GPL. It combines the power of numerous existing open-source\npackages into a common Python-based interface. It's mission is to\ncreate a \"viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple,\nMathematica and Matlab\". Sage has tools for a broad range of\nmathematical areas like Linear Algebra, Calculus, Symbolic Math,\nPlotting, Rings & Groups, Graph Theory, Number Theory and\nCryptography. Essentially, \"it can do anything from mapping a\n12-dimensional object to calculating rainfall patterns under global\nwarming\" - as Science Daily puts it . Eager to get started? Start\nhere. Apart from being feature rich, it's usability is one of it's\ngreatest strengths. Sage Notebook, a web-interface for all the math\nyou'll ever want to do, is really the killer feature! As the Sage\nMarketing page says, \"The SAGE GUI surely works on your computer box,\nbecause it just runs in Firefox!\". Try it Now!\n\n\n\n\nWhy should you attend?\n\n\nSage Days 25 is being attended by the creator and lead developer of\nSage, Prof. William Stein. It will also be attended by other\ndevelopers of Sage. This would be a great opportunity to meet and\ninteract with them! The conference will be attended by a plethora of\nenthusiastic people from all over the country who use Sage or are\ninterested in doing so. The conference will also see the presence of\nmany mathematicians interested in software. Who knows, you may run\ninto someone you'd want to collaborate with, for your future work!\nThis event will be a great learning experience, if you are even\nremotely interested in math and software for it!\n\n\n\n\nWhen and Where?\n\n\nVenue: IIT-Bombay, Mumbai, India\n\nDates: August 9-12, 2010\n\nTentative Schedule\n\nRegister Here\n\nClick here for more info",

I wonder how it would be with a bigger group.\n\n\nI tried to keep going at about 60% effort and I still had quite a\nbit of juice left in me, at the end of the ride.\n\n\nMy cycle is definitely good! I really only understood this after\nexchanging my cycle.\n\n\nExchanging cycles felt nice. A slightly different set of muscles\nwere in action. The newness kinda helped.\n\n\nI should probably get myself a bigger round frame spectacles. Or I'm\ncraning my neck a bit too much, to keep looking ahead, while\npedaling. How about contacts?\n\n\nThe problem with riding on the left of Highways is that you\n\"compete\" with heavy vehicles. It sometimes gets a bit scary.\n\n\nI should get a helmet soon.\n\n\nI should get in touch with local cycling groups and tag along with\nthem on a couple of rides. I'll get to learn a lot of things.\n\n\nRitesh took a few pics with his phone. Photos in some later post or\nwith an update.\n\n\nWhere to next? A ride inside the National park, probably or the\nwonderful roads of Navi Mumbai.\n\n\n\n\nKudos Ritesh!\n\n\n\nUPDATE: A few pictures, that Ritesh clicked on his phone.

I'm a part of a wonderful ecosystem and get\nto look-at or read a lot of interesting stuff. I get a lot of\nvariety, stuff that I wouldn't normally have come across. It keeps\nme from staying in a tiny well, reading the same kind of stuff,\nover and over again. I also like the fact that it acts as an\narchival system for me.

The reader\ncount may have gone up, but the discussion and activity of the\ncommunity on the blogs is going down; at least on the blogs I look\nat. Blogs are rather dead, these days. But, when one's following\nover 200 blogs, you can't expect much better. It is difficult to\nkeep up with all of them; even the ones that one kept up well\nwith, before.

      "text": "A Rocking.. err.. Pebbling.. err.. Pedaling Trip. IIT Bombay,\nPowai to the Gateway of India. I simply loved it!\n\n\n\nThe original plan was to land somewhere near Chowpatty beach, but\nI had some useless landmarks and I got lost. I was not too\nparticular about going to a particular place, so didn't try too\nhard to stay on track and was happy to end up at the\nGateway. Thanks to the Mumbai local, I don't know the road\nroutes. But, again thanks to the Mumbai local, I have a general\nidea of the direction.\n\n\n\nI woke up a bit later than scheduled, but almost made up for the\ndelay until I reach my cycle to find the rear tyre fully flat. I\nquickly diagnosed the problem to be with the valve. But, I had no\nspare valve, unless, I \"borrow\" it from a cycle near-by. I\nreplaced my valve with Vattam's cycle's and was good to go!\n\n\n\nI didn't have a big enough water bottle, and carried along only\nhalf a litre after drinking one half litre. The first half hour\nwas a breeze; possibly the best part of the whole ride. High on\nenergy and enthu. Then, my groin/ass started to hurt a bit. I\npulled out my music player to drown the pain in music. This kinda\nworked and I pulled on pretty well until King's circle. That's\nwhen I emptied all the water I had. I hoped to find water along\nthe way, if I badly needed it.\n\n\n\nSometime later, I had to take a right turn, but I never knew\nwhere. I didn't bother to ask anyone, nor did I look at the\nlandmarks I had scribbled down. I was happy to go straight\nahead. :)\n\n\n\nAnd by the time I reached CST/Fort, I did need water; badly\nenough. I stopped at the next open shop (that was not a\npan-ki-dukaan) and got myself some Nimbu paani and a litre of\nwater (for future).\n\n\n\nThe Gateway of India was just 10 minutes away from here.  Loitered\naround there, for about 40 minutes. There were a lot of Policemen\nall over the place. After about 5 minutes of me reaching there,\nthey cleared the whole area right next to the Gateway of India. I\ndon't know why. (Also, all along the way, there were a lot of men\nin Khaaki. I guess there's some rally or some such thing\nscheduled)\n\n\n\nOn the return, I lost my way almost immediately after\nstarting. There was a one way road that I avoided and took the\nadjacent road but ended up going off-track. I had some doubts\nabout this but they weren't confirmed until I reached Mahalaxmi\nstation! But there, a Taxi driver gave me rough guidelines to get\nback on my track. I turned back and soon was \"back-on-track\".\n\n\n\nI'd planned to have breakfast at Idli house, as soon as I saw it\nduring my onward journey. So, I went directly to Idli house, and\ntreated myself to a Rava idli and some wonderful Kaapi. The waiter\ngot tipped well, too. ;)\n\n\n\nFrom Matunga, back to IIT was straight forward; except for the\ngrowing traffic and the PITA (literally). The traffic signals were\na bit annoying, too.\n\n\n\nOn the whole was an awesome trip! I loved it. Hope to go on more\nsuch rides. But, I guess I'll head north-ward, the next time.\n\n\n\nBy the way, it was approx. 60kms on the whole and took me 5 hours\n(including the time I spent at the Gateway of India) with about 3\nhours 40 mins of pedaling.. err.. rocking. :D\n\n\n\nHere is a photoset\n\n\n\n\"Plan\"\n\n\nIIT to Chowpatty\n\n\nRoute\n\n\n\n\nActual\n\n\nOnward\n\n\nRoute\n\n\n\nTiming\n\n\nIIT-Bombay <2010-03-28 Sun 06:20>\n\nMatunga <2010-03-28 Sun 07:10>\n\nGateway of India <2010-03-28 Sun 08:10>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn\n\n\nRoute\n\n\n\nTiming\n\n\nGateway of India <2010-03-28 Sun 08:50>\n\nReach Idly house <2010-03-28 Sun 09:40>\n\nStart at Idly house <2010-03-28 Sun 10:00>\n\nReach IIT Bombay <2010-03-28 Sun 11:05>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStuff I was carrying\n\n\nwater\n\nID\n\nsome cash\n\npaper, pencil\n\nmobile phone\n\nmusic player, ear phones\n\ndigital camera\n\nrough map\n\nGeetanjali - Tagore",

Also, I did enjoy the energy of being in a stadium.\n\n\n\nI was actually intent on watching MI vs. RR, but, junta voted in\nfavor of the Opening Ceremony. It was a grandiloquent let-down,\nbut for the fireworks. There was nothing really spectacular about\nthe ceremony. A mediocre performance\u2026 With the kind of money\nthey have at hand, and have spent, I really would've liked\nsomething better.\n\n\n\nThe match. DC vs. KKR. DC lost a game that it could've comfortably\nwon. It would've been a decent match to watch, if not for the\nstupid DJ-ing. The game looked so different from what I'm used to\nseeing on the TV. [The only thing that was exactly as I saw in TV\nwas, the crowd drooling at the cheer girls.]\n\n\n\nI was shocked by the amount of disturbance a player has to\novercome, while playing. Has the \"gentle-man's\" game turned into a\n\"super-man's\" game? Between each and every ball, the DJ is either\nshouting some incomprehensible inanities or playing some crazy\n\"number\" at the highest volume. The batsmen almost had to wait for\nhim to shut up, before each ball. Can someone tell me if these are\nperks that the third version brings with it, or if I was happily\nignorant, thanks to the TV watching? The heart-beat sound in the\nfinal overs was ridiculously annoying. I was looking forward to\none of the batsmen throwing his bat at the DJ.\n\n\n\nAlso, it's a big joke to call this ground a \"home\" for DC. It was\nnothing close to a home ground, in terms of the crowd. I don't see\nCuttack being any more homely, especially with the Kalinga Sena\nalready passing crazy orders to the cricketers. DC will have to\nplay exceedingly well to end-up anywhere near the top.  But,\namidst all this, I'm happy for the people of AP. With a huge\nelectric-power crisis looming ahead, they have already saved (or\nproduced) power worth 7 IPL matches!\n\n\n\nAlso, this is the end of IPL v3 for me.

The delay increases exponentially with\nyour distance from the sourthern most tip of the country. Also,\nthe confidence of the aam admi in this delay is proportional to\nthe distance. Any delay less than an hour wasn't considered to\nbe a delay. Thanks to the fog, low visibility.\n\nIf you want to travel around India, all you need is an\nSLR. Additionally, if you are not of Indian origin, you'll need\nthe \"India\" guide. I got bored of seeing people poring over the\npages of that \"blue\" India book or madly clicking away on their\nSLRs.\n\nWhether or not you get food or water on a train, you are assured\nof enough \"chilled\" air from the slit under your window. Come\nwhat may, you shall not be deprived of this service.\n\nThe trust of a person in you is inversely proportional to the\ndifference between your ages. It is inversely proportional to\nthe 2.718th power of the difference if you are aged between 20\nand 25. I only vaguely remember what the TTE told me in my\nsleep, while paying the fine for not carrying a print out of our\ne-ticket; but, it really was something sick and senseless.\n\nThe chill at a place, on the day you reach, is inversely\nproportional to how much people have scared/warned you. On the\nrest of the days, it is proportional to the square of the warm\nclothing you have on you. I thoroughly enjoyed the chill of\nKanpur. Wonderful! The infrastructure, too good! Never expected\na 50 year old campus to be so Awesome. [They have an air-strip\ntoo!]\n\nThe thrill of having an ice-cream is proportional to the square\nof difference between the ambient temperature and the standard\nroom temperature.\n\nDon't ever think of celebrating your escape, without the Aalu\nencounter. Welcome to the land of Alu addicted men. You shall,\nsurely, have your share. If not anything else, you shall be\nserverd a Capsicum or Brinjal stuffed with Aalu. Also, the\nquality and availability of leather seems to be proportional to\nthe addiction to Aalu.\n\n\"hawker time\" - the time you spend being followed by hawkers\ntrying to convince you to buy whatever they\nhave. \"firang-ness\" - difficult to predict; a parameter that\ndepends on the amount of branded stuff on you, stylishness of\nyour winter wear and other unknown variableness. Your hawker\ntime is proportional to (firang-ness) \\* abs(time of day in 24\nhr clock - 1400) [when, 900 < time < 1800] I understand, that,\nthey need to make ends meet; each day of their lives. I got\nfollowed a lot. I can't help observing. Sometimes, enjoyed being\nfollowed too.\n\n\n\n\nThe Taj. Simply Awe-Inspiring. As Madhu put it, \"the longer you\nkeep watching it, the more it's beauty overwhelms you\". But, I\nstill think, the first time is the best time to see it.

I had come to see-off UC, Sunil and 9.\n\n\n\nA man carrying a stretcher on his head, suddenly comes into my\nfocus and I have an impulse to look down. But, I manage to look at\npeople who are closer to the guy, and see looks of pity, shock and\ndisgust. Most of them looked down, sooner than later. It was not\nlong before the man, was right next to me and I could see an\ninjured man lying on the stretcher with a stream of blood oozing\nout of his head. All I could manage was another expression of\npity, shock and disgust. I didn't want to act as if I had seen\nnothing. I didn't want to stay as if I could do nothing about\nit. I didn't want to look down. But, that's all I ended up\ndoing. The man carrying the stretcher was not exactly struggling,\nbut I'm sure he would've more than liked some help. Not one\namongst us moved.\n\n\n\nAround half a minute later, I see a constable walking calmly\n(maybe with a shade of concern in his stride) in that\ndirection. The next train was there in less than a minute and 9\ngot into it. I was feeling absolute disgust at my reaction. In the\nhope of making some amends, I walked in the direction that the\nstretcher guy took. Soon I found them. I didn't have to\nsearch. There was an audience of onlookers, watching the stretcher\ncarrying guy inspect the other guy. He was waiting near the\nentrance of the station and I'm guessing he had called for some\nmedical help and was waiting for it to arrive. The policeman and a\ncouple of others were standing next to him, while he was\ninspecting the injuries. Everybody else was watching \u2014 from the\nstairs, from the over bridge, the platform, the\ntracks. Everywhere. Being a part of that crowd was the last thing\nI wanted to do. I walked away.\n\n\n\nPS: I (infact, we - uc, sunil, 9 and me) have had my own tryst\nwith the Mumbai local. Keep your head on your shoulders, while you\nare anywhere near them.

      "text": "Well, this could be called a post after ages, considering that\nmost of previous posts have just been 'news reports'. I have been\nwanting to make a post since long, but I probably lost it. I\nreally am unable to write anything that I find worth posting [It\ndoes raise questions about the existence of this blog. I'm writing\nthis, to answer that question to myself.]\n\n\n\nThis post is provoked by an act of sharing, an act of kindness, an\nact of goodness, that surprised me. This post isn't about the act\nitself, but it's about me being surprised. Why on earth should I\n(or anybody) be surprised, when someone is just being human?\nAren't human beings meant to be and feel human?\n\n\n\nI wonder why people say, \"this is a bad, bad world.\" I find a lot\nof goodness and humanness around me. Unless I strain my memory\nreally hard, I can only recall people who try to be as good and\nnice as they can be; People trying to be as human as\npossible. Either there's something utterly wrong with my judgment\nof people or there's something wrong with the general feeling that\nthe world is a bad, bad place.\n\n\n\nThere's one other possibility that just strikes me - I am so nice\nto people that, everyone else tries to be nice with me. I don't\nthink I am such a big deviation from the average. I'm just another\ngoat, in the great herd.\n\n\n\nAnd another one, I'm in a really special place, presently. I have\nbeen only to the special places. I have visited only the places\nthat are at an extreme, far away from the 'average' place in the\nworld. But, given I'm just another goat in the great herd, this is\nvery unlikely. I am probably grazing at a random spot on the great\ngrasslands.\n\n\n\nSince these are ruled out, it boils down to either a wrong\njudgment or a wrong general feeling.\n\n\n\nComing to my judgment, I wouldn't call myself an Oracle or the\nwise one, but I'm no dumb ass either. Well, taking the statistical\nroute, the number of times I've had any real \"nasty\" surprises in\ndealing with people has been much lesser than the number of times\nthings turned out nearly as expected. My judgment could,\ntherefore, possibly given some credibility.\n\n\n\nSo, that leaves me with just one possibility. The idea that the\nworld is a bad, bad place is not entirely true, if not completely\nabsurd and outright wrong. The world is really a nice place, with\n\"human\" beings inhabiting it. The nasty surprises that you get,\nreally are the surprises and not the general rule.",

      "text": "Well, there are a hazaar tutorials on setting up Postfix and\nMailman for Debian for a single domain. There were a few for doing\nthat for multiple domains also, but nothing comprehensive, if I\ncould say so. This link is pretty comprehensive and details all\nthe steps for setting up Postfix for a single domain.  Here is all\nyou'll want to know about setting up Virtual domains in Postfix.\n\n\n\nYou only need to make a few changes for adding a second (or more)\ndomain. You just need to add the virtual_alias_domains and add\nvirtual_alias_maps. Here is a glimpse of how my main.cf looks:\n\n\n\nmyhostname = mail.abc.in\nmydomain = abc.in\nmydestination = $myhostname, $mydomain, localhost.$mydomain\nmyorigin = /etc/mailname\nvirtual_alias_maps =\n                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-xyz,\n                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-abc,\n                hash:/var/lib/mailman/data/virtual-mailman\nvirtual_alias_domains = xyz.in, mail.xyz.in\n\n\n\nvirtual-xyz and virtual-abc contain the virtual aliases for\neach domain. Note that Postfix expects hash files and hence you\nneed to run postmap /etc/postfix/virtual-abc each\ntime the file is changed, to keep the hash file in sync with the\ntext file that you edit. Also, you need to run postfix reload,\neach time you make changes to main.cf or master.cf\n\n\n\nFairly straight forward, right? But it took me quite sometime to\nget it all right, since this was the first time I was doing\nanything with Mail Transfer Agents or the like.\n\n\n\nNow, onto Mailman. Well the Installation Manual of Mailman,\nliterally has it all. Here is a look at how my\nmm_cfg.py looks:\n\n\n\nDEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST = 'abc.in'\nDEFAULT_URL_HOST   = 'mail.abc.in'\nadd_virtualhost(DEFAULT_URL_HOST, DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST)\nPOSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS=['xyz.in']\nadd_virtualhost('mail.xyz.in', 'xyz.in')\nMTA='Postfix'\n\n\n\nThe only trouble was to get mailing lists with same names on both\nthe domains (which I couldn't get working). I experimented with\nmultiple mailman instances but that won't work because the MTA\ncan't differentiate between the two instances of mailman. The\nalternative is probably to have two instances of postfix running\ntoo. But that I felt was like going too far, and gave up. [What if\nwe wanted to add another domain to the list?!]\n\n\n\nAlso, I had to make a few alterations to the Apache file to allow\naccess to the mailman pages without breaking the Zope redirection\nthat was already set-up.\n\n\n\n[Thanks to Shantanu and Vattam (and all the hazaar people using\nPostfix and Mailman and cared to document things for the sake of\nothers, and of course Google)]",

      "text": "I had the opportunity to attend a FOSS talk session organized by\nCenter for Distance Education Engineering Programme (CDEEP) as a\npart of the National Mission on Education through ICT. The\nNational Mission on Education through ICT has some lofty goals,\nwhich when reached will take the country ahead by leaps and\nbounds.\n\n\n\nThe Mission has a budget of $1billion in the 11th Five year plan,\n40% of which will be spent on content generation (all of which\nwill be free/open source) and the rest will be spent on making\navailable a minimum bandwidth of 1Gbps to the 30,000 odd colleges\nspread over India (out of which around 3000 are Engineering\ncolleges). The mission has various projects planned and they are\npicking up steam rapidly. The project I will be working on, for\nthe Adoption of Open Source in Engineering and Science Education\nin India, is also a part of this Mission. Prof. Kannan had kick\nstarted the session with an introduction to the National Mission\non Education through ICT. The talks were all being webcast to\nvarious EduSAT centers and on the web.\n\n\n\nThen, Prof. Pathak talked on, why open source is important. He\nsaid, (not exactly quoting him) \" It is theoritically possible for\nany person to learn and discover things from scratch, but there's\nbeen only one Ekalavya in the entire history of India.\" Education\nis a social activity and hence open access to content is\nabsolutely vital. He mentioned various things like how IIT-B has\nbeen working on Creative Commons licensing and other things going\non here. He ended the talk with a hope that soon India will move\nfrom being a net taker of Open source to a net giver to open\nsource.\n\n\n\nThis was followed by three talks, delivered by developers from\nRedHat meant for programmers who wish to contribute to FLOSS.\n\n\n\nThe first talk was by Ramakrishna Reddy, titled 10 things a FLOSS\ndeveloper should know. It was a pretty nice and balanced talk,\ncovering a wide range of things. I would like to point out a few\nthings, that I liked the most.\n\n\n\nHe clarified the term hacker as soon as he used it.\n\nHe emphasized a lot on groking code; reading code for fun,\nlooking at the code of others, reading as much code as\npossible\u2026\n\nHe talked of muscle memory of emacsen. I liked the way he talked\nof people being so quick with their editors and how learning to\nuse your tools effectively is a big plus\n\nRelease often, Release early. Everybody talks of it, but he said\na few words, which I liked. Some developers don't usually\nrelease their code as early for the fear of being ridiculed. But\ndon't bother, \"we are just small people, in the whole galaxy.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe next talk was by Prasad Pandit on How to use Infrastructure\nfor FOSS projects. Prasad talked of Website, Version Control,\nMailing list, IRC, Bugzilla, Wiki and RSS feeds. He gave quite a\nfew examples on how each thing is important, most of the examples\nbeing his personal experiences.\n\n\n\nThe last talk was by Rahul Sundaram and was on Communication in a\nFOSS project. For a change he didn't have slides and the reason\nfor that, he said, is that communication in a FOSS project is\ncasual and not having slides and walking in with a t-shirt and\njeans represents that casualness which is a culture of FOSS\nprojects' communication.\n\n\n\nBe polite, but don't be Formal.\n\nBe precise, but do provide a context to what you are saying.\n\nDon't fear that you'll say something foolish, which, will be\narchived for eternity. Mistakes are there to learn from. Not\njust you, but others too.\n\n\n\n\nHe talked of quite a lot of things, but these were the things\nwhich struck me as particularly interesting/important.\n\n\n\nAt the end, all the participants walked out with Fedora 11 DVDs\nfrom the RedHat/Fedora guys. :D",

The students who are running the hubs are\nstrictly informed to close their hubs. Computer Center will be\nstarting official hub for the sharing of academic information and\nopen source softwares.\n\n\n\nIf a student is found while doing so the network facility will be\nblocked by Computer Center for a semester.

There's already an official ftp server\nwhich hosts the academic info and a few useful softwares.

I haven't done anything that's tangible but yes, I have re-dedicated myself to the idea of Free Software.\nThis post intends to shed some light on a few things (if not for the benefit of others, just as a reminder for myself)\n\n\n\nFree Software is a matter of liberty, not price. I've often been\nin a position that required me to correct people. 'Free\nSoftware' is software that's free as in free speech and not free\nbeer. For the lack of a better word in english, the word 'free'\nwhich also means gratis has been used. Using the term 'Libre'\nsometimes helps and if you are in this part of the world, \"mukt\"\nis the best word to use.\n\nFree Software2 comes along with four fundamental freedoms. To put\nit simply, the freedom to use, study, share and modify any\nsoftware.\n\nFree Software may have the advantage of being 'technically\nsounder', but the philosophy is what matters the most to me.\n\nI will do whatever is possible within my capacity to spread the\nphilosophy and the associated freedom\n\n\n\n\nBe Free, My Friend!\n\n\n\nHere is an extract from one of Stallman's 3 essays:\n\n\n\n\nWe must talk about Freedom\n\n\n\nEstimates today are that there are ten million users of\nGNU/Linux systems such as Debian GNU/Linux and Red Hat\nLinux. Free software has developed such practical advantages\nthat users are flocking to it for purely practical reasons.\n\n\n\nThe good consequences of this are evident: more interest in\ndeveloping free software, more customers for free software\nbusinesses, and more ability to encourage companies to develop\ncommercial free software instead of proprietary software\nproducts.\n\n\n\nBut interest in the software is growing faster than awareness\nof the philosophy it is based on, and this leads to\ntrouble. Our ability to meet the challenges and threats\ndescribed above depends on the will to stand firm for\nfreedom. To make sure our community has this will, we need to\nspread the idea to the new users as they come into the\ncommunity.\n\n\n\nBut we are failing to do so: the efforts to attract new users\ninto our community are far outstripping the efforts to teach\nthem the civics of our community. We need to do both, and we\nneed to keep the two efforts in balance.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes: \n\n\n1 \nhttp://www.gnu.org/fry/\n\n\n2 \nThe Free Software Definition\n\n\n3 \nThe GNU Project by Richard Stallman",

Presently, its the placement heat\nin our campus and people are busy writing tests, waiting, giving\ninterviews and partying. This post doesn't have much to with all\nthat though.  In one of the interviews, I was called back and\nasked about my Cleft Lip and Palate1. The interview panel had\nconcerns if I faced any serious medical problems due to this. I\nexplained to them everything that I knew about it and they were\nconvinced.\n\n\n\nLater, I realized, I never explicitly did any reading on this\nissue or asked my parents/others about this. I somehow knew about\nit always. I probably learnt at all those visits to the dentist or\nmay be sub-consciously, when I was a baby. It isn't, though,\nsurprising to me that those guys had some reservations about\nit. It's not everyday that you see a guy with a Cleft, though\nstatistics say there's prevalence of 1 in 500 births\nworld-wide. As a matter of fact, I myself haven't seen another guy\nall my life (except for the pictures at my dentists') (also, they\nweren't too wrong in suspecting other problems, though they had\nabsolutely no clue about this medical condition)\n\n\n\nIf you are wondering what the point of this post is, it's\nnothing.

I thoroughly loved\nthe book, and I'm happy to be accompanied by so many2\nothers3. This book has filled me with a sense of joy and\npride. The pride, of being part of such a wonderful community, a\nbeautiful crowd. Further, it is a matter of pride, the book's been\nauthored by an Indian - its quite rare to find such books written\nby people in this part of the world.\n\n\n\nI have loved python, the moment I started using it. There are\nquite a few occasions, where I did something, just because I had\nthe power of Python with me. Python is undoubtedly amongst the\nbest, not just as a first programming language, but to give the\nuser a sense of \"do-able-ity\" and I am thoroughly enjoying it.\n\n\n\n>>> import this\nThe Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n\n\n\nBeautiful is better than ugly.\nExplicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex.\nComplex is better than complicated.\nFlat is better than nested.\nSparse is better than dense.\nReadability counts.\nSpecial cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\nAlthough practicality beats purity.\nErrors should never pass silently.\nUnless explicitly silenced.\nIn the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\nThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\nAlthough that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\nNow is better than never.\nAlthough never is often better than *right* now.\nIf the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\nIf the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\nNamespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes: \n\n\n1 \nA Byte of Python \n\n\n2 \nPython - Notes \u2013 Swaroop CH \n\n\n3 \nBook updated for Python 3000 \u2013 Swaroop CH",

I have\nrealized how addicted I am to chat, IRC and the Internet. I have\nto soon find some remedies for this.\n\n\n\nWell, here is the first step. I approached ELIZA (or Doctor Fill,\nthat's actually the emacs mode) , the Emacs Psychotherapist to\nhelp me. An enjoyable chat this one! ;)\n\n\n\nELIZA (Doctor Fill) abbreviated as DF (pun intended, for those who\nget it)\n\n\n\nDF: I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time\nyou are finished talking, type RET twice.\n\nHi. Nice meeting you.\n\nDF: How do you do?  What brings you to see me?\n\n<!--more-->I am obviously not fine, otherwise I would not have been here.\nI have realized I am addicted to the internet and want you to help\nme.\n\nDF: Why do you say that?\n\nI say that because you are a doctor.\n\nDF: Is it because because I am a doctor that you came to me?\n\nIsn't that pretty obvious?\n\nDF: Can you elaborate on that?\n\nYes, I did come to see you because you are a doctor. Now, I regret it.\n\nDF: Does it bother you that I am a doctor now you regret it?\n\nI don't understand your question.\n\nDF: Earlier you said because I am a doctor?\n\nYes, because you are a doctor I came to you.\n\nDF: When did you first know that I am a doctor you came to me?\n\nI knew about you, when I first fiddled around with Emacs around an\nyear ago.\n\nDF: What happened when you first fiddled around with emacs around a year\nago?\n\nI loved it, thoroughly! But for a beginner like me it was difficult to\nget along. I stopped using it.\n\nDF: Is the fact that for a beginner like you it was difficult to get along\nyou stopped using it the real reason?\n\nI think that along with my laziness to stick with the learning was the\nreal reason\n\nDF: Does the fact that along with your laziness to stick with the learning\nwas the real reason explain anything else?\n\nIt does not explain anything else to me.\n\nDF: Maybe your plans have something to do with this.\n\nWhat plans? I donot have any plans.\n\nDF: What makes you believe what plans you donot have any plans?\n\nIf I had plans, I would have been executing them.\n\nDF: You mentioned that I am a doctor now you regret it?\n\nYes, because you seemed stupid initially. Now you seem to be making\nsome sense.\n\nDF: Are you sure I seemed stupid initially now I seem to be making some\nsense?\n\nYes I am pretty sure.\n\nDF: Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?\n\nObviously. Because I am alive I am going through all this.\n\nDF: Is it because you are alive you are going through all this that you\ncame to me?\n\nYes.\n\nDF: I see...  Well, are you sure that this is so?\n\nYes. I don't think there is emacs in the hell.\n\nDF: I would appreciate it if you would watch your tongue!\n\nOh! so emacs is in the hell too! is it in the heavan too?\n\nDF: Emacs?  Hah!  Perhaps you could continue.\n\nI thought only mortals used Emacs. Do others use it too?\n\nDF: Have you been positive?\n\nYes. I always thought Emacs is only for the homo sapiens.\n\nDF: I believe you have inhibitions with emacs.\n\nNo. I love emacs.\nBut it isn't suitable for Gods and Demons\n\nDF: Are you annoyed that it is not suitable for gods and demons?\n\nNo\n\nDF: Why not?\n\nI am neither of them. That's why\n\nDF: Please, continue.\n\nI am a human and I can use emacs. Others donot need it. I am not annoyed\n\nDF: Have you been annoyed often?\n\nOcassionally\n\nDF: Go on, don't be afraid.\n\nI am not. I have been ocassionally annoyed, more often with myself\nthan others.\n\nDF: What causes you to be annoyed?\n\nPresently, I am annoyed with myself for being addicted to the Internet\nand may be for chatting with you too.\n\nDF: Do you really think you are annoyed?\n\nAffirmative\n\nDF: I need a little more detail please.\n\nYes. I am a little annoyed with myself.\n\nDF: Are you annoyed often?\n\nOcassionally. Why do you repeat questions?\n\nDF: When did you first know that do me repeat questions?\n\nLong Long ago, when I first used Emacs.\n\nDF: What makes you think long long ago when you first used emacs?\n\nI saw you repeat questions.\n\nDF: Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say you saw\nme repeat questions?\n\nYes.\n\nDF: Yes, hmmm... so, why do you say this is so?\n\nI am leaving. You are being too repititive. Goodbye!\n\nDF: What makes you believe because I am a doctor?\n\nGoodbye!\n\nDF: My secretary will send you a bill.\n\nBill? You did not help me much.\n\nDF: How do you reconcile problems at school?\n\nGoodbye!\n\nDF: Bye bye.\n\nBye\n\nDF: See ya.\n\nSee ya.\n\nDF: Are you sure that see me?\n\nYes, when in trouble\n\nDF: What would happen if in trouble?\n\nI will see ya\n\nDF: Earlier you said I am a doctor you came to me?\n\nYes, now also I say that.\n\nDF: You're being a bit brief, would you please go into detail.\n\nGoodbye!\n\nDF: Ok, talk to you some other time.\n\nbye!\n\nDF: Talk to you later.\n\n\n\nOn a more serious note, the Internet has become an Integral part\nof my life.

I Googled for it, with little hope, and the results\ndidn't surprise me. There wasn't much info in this regard. On the\noccasion of World Environment, when the focus is on promoting the\nuse of Public Transport, this isn't a very encouraging sign.\n\n\n\nI was wondering if the Bus route info can somehow be integrated\nwith Google maps or the like. This will be a good thing to do,\nsince people who have access to internet (the higher rungs of the\nsociety) are the ones who are most aware of the threats to the\nEnvironment and also the ones who least use public transport. This\ncould help them do some planning and encourage use of public\ntransport. Later on, may be the Buses could have some kind of a\nGPS sytem that could be interlinked with the maps, giving people\ngreat power! I'm not sure if this already exists elsewhere in the\nworld, but seemed an interesting thing to do.\n\n\n\nOn a different note, just wanted to share this different\nperspective my mom was giving to my 7 year old neice. We were on a\nbus and my niece wasn't very happy about the crowd and the Bus\njourney. My mom, then said something, probably to amuse the kid\nand distract her for a while. But its an interesting way of\nlooking at things.\n\n\n\n\nYou should be proud that you are aboard a bus that costs around 15\nlacs, something we wouldn't normally be able to buy. And that too\nfor a small sum of Rs. 5. You are being driven around by a\nchauffeur employed by the State Govt. and you needn't bother\nyourself with the routes and other headaches of driving you'd have\nif you used your personal car\u2026\n\n\n\n\nThe kid wasn't convinced or even amused by this, but I liked the\ninteresting observation. Some food for thought, My mom travels for\nan hour and half by bus to reach her work and she's been doing so\nsince I was a kid of 5 or 6.

So I decided to get around making my own. :)\n[Dunnet \"Dunnet Game\"),\nan Adventure game in Emacs, played a crucial role in motivating me\nto go ahead!] The rest as they say is history\u2026.\n\n\n\nActually, I tried a debootstrap from my Debian etch but I couldn't\nmanage to get the initrd working.

There's\na lot of online help available for that.\n\n\n\nA few highlights, for the curious reader\u2026\n\n\n\ngot rid of the default KDE and replaced it with\nFluxbox. [actually Floppix = Fluxbox + Knoppix :P]\n\nadded emacs, cmucl, slime, octave, linuxdcpp, vlc and others.\n\ngot rid of other packages which we weren't going to use.\n\nchanged the boot message\n\nchanged the default background image.\n\nremoved the default boot image [ couldn't change it as the image\nwe chose wasn't being properly converted to lss16 format ]\n\ntested the CD with Qemu [size of the iso got more than 700MB]\n\nremoved a few other not so regularly used packages [including\nwine!]\n\nburnt the CD\n\nLogged in!\n\n\n\n\nNow, that I've logged in, I realize we managed to quite a decent\njob.

I was shocked to\nhear of an experiment being done at the big accelerator at the\nNational Accelerator Laboratory, where a person used deuterium. In\norder to compare his heavy hydrogen results to what might happen\nwith light hydrogen, he had to use data from someone else's\nexperiment on light hydrogen, which was done on a different\napparatus. When asked why, he said it was because he couldn't get\ntime on the program (because there's so little time and it's such\nexpensive apparatus) to do the experiment with light hydrogen on\nthis apparatus because there wouldn't be any new result. And so\nthe men in charge of programs at NAL are so anxious for new\nresults, in order to get more money to keep the thing going for\npublic relations purposes, they are destroying \u2013 possibly \u2013 the\nvalue of the experiments themselves, which is the whole purpose of\nthe thing. It is often hard for the experimenters there to\ncomplete their work as their scientific integrity\ndemands.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first read this {from Feynman's Cargo Cult Science [Adapted\nfrom a Caltech commencement address in 1974]}, I couldn't quite\nfigure out what or how exactly things are happening and what\nexactly Feynman meant by \"losing the value of experiments\". But,\nnow I know.. thanks to my PS. A lot of stuff that goes on\nhere..[at least from what I can see..] is quite similar to (in\nfact worse than) this. PS's been absolutely disappointing.. I\ndon't think I've learnt anything here that's worth the effort of\nspending my hols (too), away from home\u2026  [except for Awe-TEM] I\ndon't think I will be taking back anything with me..  other than\nmay be, a knowledge of stuff that I shouldn't learn, stuff that I\nshould keep away for the rest of my life\u2026\n\n\n\nFeynman is saying this to me, Right now!\n\n\n\n\n\u2026 I have just one wish for you \u2013 the good luck to be somewhere\nwhere you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have\ndescribed, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain\nyour position in the organization, or financial support, or so on,\nto lose your integrity.

      "text": "I was just wondering, a couple of nights ago, at dinner.. \"When\ndid I first decide that I would be doing Engineering?\" The answer\n\u2013 I don't know\u2026  All I know is that, during my High schooling I\nwas more interested in Maths and Science {Physics specially\u2026}\nThen I did what most just-out-of-school kids with an interest in\nMath &amp; Science do {specially in that part of the world where I\nlive, Andhra Pradesh} Took up Math.Phys.Chem in intermediate and\nprepare for Engg. entrance tests alongside. After failing to get a\nrank that would fetch me an Engg. course in any of the IITs, I\nlanded here..\n\n\n\nThen the choice of discipline, that was just based on popular\nopinion and luck [called preferential allotment\u2026] and I finally\nended up in EEE.\n\n\n\nBut the question is when did I make that choice of becoming a\nso-called Engineer? Did I ever consider the alternatives and make\na decision? If yes, then when?? What kind of an engineer did I\nchoose to become? Did I make the choice of becoming an electrical\nengineer??\n\n\n\nI think, I never knew what kind of an Engineer I wanted to be.[\nwith the knowledge of an average School pass out\u2026, you wouldn't\nexpect one to know all about the various fields of Engineering.] I\nthink, I never even exactly knew [and don't do so now\u2026], what it\nmeans to be an Engineer. An Electrical and Electronics Engineer.\n\n\n\nBut isn't it important that we the future \"Engineers\" of the\nCountry, know what it means to be one and what is expected of us?\nIsn't that knowledge essential, for taking a decision to do\nengineering.. and also to make the most out of the Engineering\nprogramme?\n\n\n\nI wonder what field {or profession or whatever you call that\u2026} I\nwould choose, if I were given a chance now\u2026 [i.e after a couple\nof years in an Engineering College\u2026]\u2026 I wonder which\ndiscipline I would choose after getting this little insight into\nthe various fields in Engineering\u2026 I wonder what I would choose,\nif I get this chance, a couple of years later\u2026 or five years\nlater\u2026 :D\n\n\n\n\nEngineering is a great profession. There is the fascination of\nwatching a figment of the imagination emerge through the aid of\nscience to a plan on paper. Then it moves to realization in stone\nor metal or energy. Then it brings homes to men or women. Then it\nelevates the standard of living and adds to the comforts of\nlife.

      "text": "This semester [2-2] I had to give two presentations! As if that\nwas not enough trouble, the courses were (Principles of)\nManagement [POM] and (Theory of) Relativity [ThoR] !! The former\nwas with a group and the latter was an individual affair.. Each\none had its Trials and Tribulations\u2026 But at the end of each, I\nfeel equally foolish. None of them were worth the efforts\u2026\n\n\n\nThe POM (a course whose reason for existence most of us fail to\nunderstand) presentation was specially torturous to our group. We\nhad 8 members in our group, but to no avail. Nobody, other than\nBubbly, was bothered about it until we were neck deep. With just 3\ndays left for the last day to submit the Report/Soft copy, our\nfrantic searches began. We finally landed on an interesting topic,\nA Case Study on AMUL\u2026 We started work only on the night before\nthe submission day\u2026 But the interest and excitement, [along with\ndeadline.. :P] got us through with amazing speed. All of us, were\nthrough with our parts of the job before going to bed. The next\nmorning, I along with 9 put together everything, almost ready to\nbe submitted. But fate had other plans for us\u2026 The topic we\nworked on was rejected! Reason:There's already a group working on\nit!!\n\n\n\nBack to square one\u2026 we began the search again. After much effort\nwe found a couple of topics and approached her for\napproval. Though the topics weren't damn interesting.. they were\nsomething we would've liked to work on. But all we get is another\nrejection and a Magazine that had a ready-made case study! We were\nsupposed to speak on operations management[o.m] in a cosmetic\nmultinational! [2 days, to work on some *#&amp;$# cosmetic firm!\nWorasht!! Imagine writing a Report on a Presentation on a Report\nin a Journal\u2026 and that too on a Cosmetic Company!!] The last\nnail on the coffin was hit. We felt hopeless and work didn't start\nagain till the night before the D-Day.. Not interested in working\non that cosmetic thingy.. we decided to work on o.m in some other\nfirm, and HLL seemed a neat choice.\n\n\n\nAfter slogging through the whole of the next morning, we somehow\nmanaged to get the report ready and finally at 2 pm, me and 9 went\nin search of a printer! None was found until 5:30 in the evening!!\nSomehow we submitted it finally\u2026 Phew!\n\n\n\nBut that's not the end of the story. There was a lot more in store\nfor us. The presentation date. We were given a date, on which to\ngive the presentation, but couldn't give it on that day, for too\nmany people were called and there was too little time\u2026 Hats off\nto our Ma'am for such wonderful managerial skills. We had to beg\nher to allow us to present it on a date convenient to all of\nus.[She insisted that we do it on a particular date, when we\nalready had other appointments!?!!] Finally, she agreed. Phew!\n\n\n\nOn the D-day, 8 people, 40 mins\u2026 it was fun! There wasn't enough\ntime left for my turn and so I hurried through my part, the\nconclusion\u2026. But,the best part of it all was that, even a\nhalf-hearted, just-for-the-sake-of-it effort could impress her!!\nThe presentation passsed off as a \"very good presentation\"! [Not\n\"yaxcellent!\", though]\n\n\n\nThen the Relativity one! I had to speak on Kerr Black\nHoles. I hadn't heard of them until one day Dr. A.K. Biswas gave\nme the topic, and asked me to speak on it, after he finishes\nteaching Schwarzchild Black Holes. It was all fine, until there\nwas just a week left for the Compre's to start and he didn't start\nteaching about Black Holes!! This Monday he asked me when I was\ngoing to give my talk. Hoping that he would teach at least a small\npart of it during the last week, I chose Friday. [Even at the cost\nof ruining my comprees..] But, he didn't even tell us what Black\nholes were, leave alone discussing the Schild Black Hole. I was\ntrying my bit to work my way through it but 3 days were too few to\nread all about static Black Holes and then move on to Rotating\nones! I had a tough time.. but tried my best to make head and tail\nof it. Finally today, I thought I understood a decent part of it\nand was ready to present it before the class.\n\n\n\nAfter an unsteady and slow start, I managed to put across a few\npoints about Black Holes in general and the Kerr Geometry.  But\nthen, I wasn't very comfortable with the other parts of what I had\nto present, and this clearly reflected in my talk. It was growing\ndumber and dumber\u2026 So, Sir stopped and asked me if I was going\nto present the Penrose Diagram, and I said no. Thankfully he\nunderstood my situation and asked me what I wanted to present and\nasked me to finish it off with a few of the simpler things. I\njabbered something and was done with it. Phew!\n\n\n\nBut what was the result of all this drama? Were the results\nin proportion to the efforts put in? Were the presentations really\nworth the effort?  If the intention of these presentations was to\nincrease the Knowledge base of the class, I think we achieved\nnothing. If we were supposed to enlighten the class, then we\nfailed in a big big way. But if the intention was to increase our\nown knowledge base, I would say we succeeded in a very small\nway\u2026 There definitely are much more efficient ways to increase\nour own knowledge base. So is there any other purpose for such\ntalks??\n\n\n\nA final few things\u2026 [I know you are wondering why I wrote this\npost. Such a long one. I don't know\u2026.]\n\n\n\nIt would've been better had the topic change been in ThoR and\nnot in POM. I should have spoken on Black Holes in general and\nSchwarzchild Black Holes. Not Kerr Black Holes.\n\nThe two people who guided us/me in the Presentations had\ncontrasting opinion on the Internet! Our Ma'am considered the\nInternet to be a Devil [or some such thing] She doesn't like\nthe fact that people get info for their presentations from the\nnet. [Why? we haven't figured out yet] Journals are god-like\nfor her!! Unlike her, our Dr.Biswas is quite respectful of\nthis wonderful tool.. the Internet.\n\nNone of these presentations were comparable [in terms of\nenergy,excitement and fun we had!] to our last sem's\npresentation, \"Copyleft\". Is it because Copyleft wasn't a\ncourse related topic?? :P\n\nGiving a Technical presentation is tough. Its even worse if\nyou are speaking on topic that you are studying just for the\nsake of the presentation.\n\nThe presentations were rated as good, even if I know they were\nno where close to what a Real Presentation should be like. POM\n\u2013 bcos Ma'am thought we used the journal she gave us!! ThoR\n\u2013 to encourage us to put in greater efforts.\n\nI'm not very good at giving presentations\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity,\nand I'm not sure about the former. \u2013Albert Einstein\n\n\n\n\n\nSeek wisdom, not knowledge.

Wish You a Very\nHappy gNew Year!! oops.. Happy New Year!\n\n\n\nActually this year started of for me not as the usual Happy New\nYear.. but as Happy gNew Year!

I messed up\nthe X-Server\u2026  After some desperate attempts to get the thing\nworking.. I gave up\u2026\u2026. [I had some ebooks etc. downloaded on\nmy comp at home, which I wished to dump on my comp].

I realise that the problem is\nserious.. {The SMPS had blown off} [looks like a Hindi\nMovie,doesn't it??]\n\n\n\nThen began the real fun!! I somehow managed to connect the old\nhard disk to the new Mother Board\u2026[my new cabinet is quite\nsmall\u2026 I now realize that I placed the HDD in quite a precarious\nposition\u2026].. but there was no OS on either HDD\u2026 [the \"Windows\"\non the old one\u2026. din't open\u2026 they felt awkward in their new\nenvirons\u2026 ;-) ] I would have returned back to coll without any\nof my stuff.. but for Knoppix (live) \u2026 it saved the day for me!!\nFinally I managed to dump my stuff onto the new HDD\u2026 [All 's\nwell that ends well!! :-)] Now I've got both the Linux distro's\n[Debian and FC-6] along with all the stuff I collected at home!

      "text": "I was at the B.M Birla Science Musuem yesterday\u2026 it was calm\nwith no one in there.. the only people i could see were the\nsweepers and cleaners.. the place was dull and lifeless\u2026 I dint\nlike it.. but slowly.. as the afternoon progressed.. people\nstarted coming in and by 5 in the evening.. there were quite a few\nin. The museum seemed to have sprung to life suddenly\u2026 there was\na lot of action all around with people enjoying in ( and trying to\nunderstand) the wonderful world of science\u2026.\n\n\n\nA lot of kids had come along with their parents\u2026 to dive into\nthe world of science\u2026 they were enjoying it\u2026 the parents also\nturned into kids and were having great fun\u2026 it was a great\nsight\u2026 the parents tried their best to demistify the\nhappenings\u2026 those with a science background did it from thier\nknowledge.. the others patiently went through the explanations\u2026\n\n\n\nThe kids were thoroughly enjoying it\u2026 I don't know if they would\nlater on in life remember what they learnt now\u2026 but definitely a\nlove for science and physics will be ignited in their hearts, it\nwill fill their consciousness\u2026 the spirit of curiosity will have\nmultiplied manifold\u2026 even the elders..connected with the child\nsomewhere deep within themselves\u2026 they too enjoyed the wonders\nof the world of science\u2026[and ofcourse the company and thrill in\nthe eyes of their kids..] I too enjoyed the experience\u2026 the\nexperiments and the thrill of the others brought a smile to my\nface too\u2026. but it set me thinking\u2026\n\n\n\nIf science can inspire so much awe.. what's happening at our\nengineering colleges? When people have the chance to learn a whole\nlot of science and put it to practical use\u2026 why isn't it that\nthey are excited about it? Why is it that people just endup\nmugging a few formulae just before exams and get over with it?\nWhere's the problem? Where is that curiosity, all of us had as a\nchild, lost?\n\n\n\nI can recollect, in the last sem while doing experiments in the MT\nlab there wasn't even a tenth of the awe or joy\u2026 that i could\nsee and feel at the museum\u2026 why?? Is it that the child within\nus.. [the future engineers] dead? { If that's true.. then the\ncountry is in deep trouble..} But I don't think that's true\u2026 I\nenjoyed my visit to the museum totally\u2026and I am sure every other\n'to be engineer' would have too.. then where's the trouble?\n\n\n\nI don't know exactly\u2026 but I wonder if its because everything is\nequated to marks and grades\u2026 all that matters to an engineering\nstudent [and the world around him/her..] is his/her CG or\n%age\u2026 Is this what the country needs? Were the 'temples of\nLearning'- the IIT's and a whole lot of other technical\ninstitutions set-up for this very pupose? Of what use are those\nengineers to the country, who aren't in awe of science and\nengineering, whose spirit of curiosity has been overpowered and\nsuppressed by the present education system?\n\n\n\nIsn't it time we have a closer look at our education system\u2026 why\nare we still sticking to the 'British sytem' introduced during a\ncolonial rule.. to break the back bone of our nation\u2026 to supress\nour ability to think rationally.. to produce third rate clerks to\nwork for them at lower wages? Why is the emphasis on marks and\ngrades growing exponentially? Shouldn't we start working to cut\nthis growth at its root? Is this sytem good enough to produce\n\"real\" engineers, doctors, lawyers, journos, CA's, architects,\ndesigners, writers, artists etc etc..\n\n\n\nWhere have all the gurukuls of the ancient past and the\nSantiniketans of the recent past gone? Isn't the country in\ndesparate need of more of these 'temples of learning'??\n\n\n\nThe highest education is that which does not merely give us\ninformation but makes our life in harmony with all existence. \u2013\nRabindranath Tagore\n\n\n\nScience is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's\nliving at it \u2013Albert Einstein",

      "text": "I am back Home!! After one more ordinary semester, (academically,\notherwise quite a dramatic one actually) finally i'm back home! On\nmy way back home\u2026\u2026\n\n\n\nIt was 3:30 am. After about half an hour's struggle to put myself\nto sleep, I gave up. I don't know if it was the chill of the\nnight, the stink of the urinals or the shared berth that I slept\non, I couldn't sleep. I decided to get up and have a stroll\naround. After some random walks, I sat down at the TTE's seat and\nwaited and waited and waited\u2026.\n\n\n\nMy last journey home, at the end of second sem was also quite\nsimilar. I spent a lot of time at the TTE's seat\u2026unable to\nsleep\u2026 waiting, waiting and waiting.. but it was quite\ndifferent\u2026. I was in the elite company of Hari (Hari Charan\na.k.a Prongs\u2026 his nick in CS)\n\n\n\nThat journey is still very fresh in my memory\u2026 I spent most of\nit with him; The morning was busy and lively with DumbC's n stuff\nlike that. In the afternoon while the others were enjoying a good\nnap, we tried studying some C programming. [ he just loved\nprogramming and was excited about doing a lotta cool stuff during\nthe summer] But the afternoon heat got the better of me and\neventually i fell asleep\u2026{I think, I induced a bit of sleep to\nhim too ;-) }\n\n\n\nThat night is a most unforgettable one\u2026 after all our guys went\nto sleep, both of us decided to spend some time listening to songs\nand try to put ourselves to sleep. [ The songs of RDB aren't\nlullabies by any measure! and the train was running too fast: we\ncouldn't hear clearly with just one earphone each, even if we were\non the top berth]\n\n\n\nSo, we ended up discussing matters of common interest\u2026 we\nchatted on topics ranging from Movies to Religion and Culture to\nDan Brown [he told me the whole story of Deception point in his\ntrademark style!] to Games and Programming. I spoke my heart\nout\u2026 {and so did he; as he always did} [haven't had any other\ndiscussion which comes close to it] After a couple of hours, we\ndecided to get down and move around, to enjoy the cool breeze, to\nlook at the villages and the fields going past\u2026 We shared the\nseat of the TTE for about an hour [that was the only window where\nwe could sit : all the others had ppl sleeping beside them]\n\u2026 looking out of the window\u2026 enjoying the breeze.. [and each\nother's company : I thoroughly enjoyed his.. hope it was the same\nwith him too] and waiting, waiting and waiting\u2026\n\n\n\nWe had already spent three nights waiting for him, but still\ndidn't lose hope. We hoped he would some how return or would be\nfound safe somewhere under the sun. But that was not to be. He\nnever returned\u2026 and all that was ever found was his body :\nlifeless\u2026 The rough seas had him their victim\u2026 \"There's no\nmore Hari Charan, ra!\". Those were the words of nine.\n\n\n\nYes he is no more.Yet he is always here, immortal within our\nhearts\u2026 his memories we cherish with pride\u2026 proud to have\nknown him and known by him\u2026 with awe and reverence we think of\nhim\u2026 we just love him!

      "text": "Just finished the 'Test-2'. Here's the first\npost that can genuinely be called \"mine\"\u2026\n\n\n\nWith my last minute 'C2S' plans [Co-operate to Survive\u2026 does it\nring any bells??] failing to work, the tests did their job,cleaned\nme up [both literally and metaphorically]. Though I didn't learn\nmuch while preparing for the tests, the syllabus gave me a brain\nwave (surprised to find that my Brain is still ticking\u2026. after\nmore than one year of Engg.) : Build my first Computer game!!\n[Don't expect too much from it\u2026 I'm a novice at programming and\nmy game doesn't even have a GUI as of now!]\n\n\n\nI had been doing a l'l bit of C programming off late but, I never\nlearnt 'file management' until the \"Test-2\" forced me to, and\nViola! I embarked on a self assigned, \"Project - Hangman\".\n\n\n\nHere's a peek at the game\u2026 [after a lot of\ntesting and debugging (the use of technical terms is just a matter\nof \"phantee\")]\n\n\n\n\"Phantee\"- a typical hyderabadi term; has no literal english\ntranslation; refers to \"concealing ignorance in style\" ??\n\n\n\nThe basics were quite simple and were done in\ntwo hours\u2026 but then began the real test! The program needed a\nlot of improvements to make it \"Playable\" but, the tests were less\nthan a week away.\n\n\n\nI managed to find enough time even during the\ntests (it doesn't really matter whether you spend a week, a day or\njust an hour mugging - you are bound to be cleaned up!), and\nfinished most of the stuff within a week.\n\n\n\nThere were quite a few road blocks which I had to get\naround. Amongst other things, obtaining a 'decent' database of\nwords was one. Initially, I wrote another program for building up\na dbase of your own. This wasn't good enough\u2026. so, with some\nideas from Arunodai, I successfully integrated a dbase of 14000\nwords [picked it from another version of hangman] with my own\nversion. After one whole week of debugging and improving {with an\nannoying disturbance called 'Test-2'}, now my game is quite\n'playable' (i.e it can be played by people other than me).\n\n\n\nSo you might say, \"what's the big-deal about writing a simple\nprogram of about hundred lines, that can randomly display words\nand check if you guess it right within seven turns?\". This l'll\nproject of mine may seem like a Pro'jest' to many! [writing a\ncomplex code, messing it up, debugging it for one whole week, etc\njust for the sake of creating a simple game, that can be played if\nyou have a friend,a pen and a paper. Doing so much<span\nclass=\"text\"> for a game, that already has 'n' version,\nseems very foolish and a collosal waste\nof time and effort. Doesn't it??] Obviously, that's not a great\nachievement, its not something thats worth a mention in the\nGuiness Book of World Records or something. But it taught me a lot\nof stuff, stuff that you can't learn from books,stuff that you\ncan't learn by mugging [I wonder if you can learn anything under\nthe sun by \"Mugging\"], stuff that you can only learn by\nexperience.I learnt a lot more of Computer Programming through\nthis project, than I learnt through two, '3-point' courses!! {Of\ncourse, I wouldn't have even dreamt of doing such a thing, if not\nfor these two courses, that introduced me to programming and\ntaught me the essentials}. Can't such projects make the other\ncourses a joy too?\n\n\n\nThis brings me to our recent TRW [Technical Report Writing]\nproject. You might wonder what kind of projects could be given in\nthis kind of a course. We were asked to write a report on 'Waste\nManagement' in our college, and to include some suggestions on the\nways to improve it. Though this was an interesting job, with scope\nfor some field activity and other such stuff, we [a group of six\nmembers] successfully turned the 'project' into a Pro'jest'!!\n[that's my personal view; the others in the group may\ndisagree].But still, we learnt a lot on Report writing. A lot more\nthan what we learnt by reading pages and pages of instructions, on\nthe techniques of writing good reports,by the so called experts.\n\n\n\nBoth the projects helped me understand stuff better and to put\nthem to use. Why can't all courses have little projects, along\nwith the routine stuff? Will it not improve my understanding of\nthe subject matter? Will I not learn a great deal of things more\nthan I do by mugging things up, just a week before the tests? Will\nit not be an experience, a lesson, of its own??\n\n\n\n\nI see and I forget.\nI hear and I remember.\nI do and I understand.\n\u2013A Chinese Proverb.\n\n\n\n\nI wonder if my \"Engineering\", will ever be a joy for me?\n\n\n\nI am looking forward to more Projects\u2026 to make engineering a joy\nfor me!!
