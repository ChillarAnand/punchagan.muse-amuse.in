It was a pleasant Saturday evening, in the middle of the winter.
Christmas was just round the corner and love, in the air. The sun was
just setting, and everything outside his window was given a fresh coat
of snow, tickled by the red, quickly fading light. Not that he
noticed. He stared blankly out of the window, looking at nothing in
particular. He had just woke up from his afternoon nap, but he'd buy
it, if you told him he'd been sleeping for an year…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You could see the icy river, crawling ahead, from his window.  People
walking over the bridge, a few camera flashes going off, people
stopping over and looking far ahead into the horizon, collecting their
thoughts, couples walking hand-in-hand enjoying each others'
company… You could see it all, from up there! But, as they say, you
only see what you look for. And he, couldn't see any of this. His
looked out of his window, and saw none of this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He is walking down the same bridge. He didn't know where he was going;
his head at least. His legs did; as always. He was walking down in his
regular yellow shirt and black jeans, that you could mistake for a
uniform, if you followed him for a few days. Extremely under-dressed
for the chilly night, one would say. He kept walking down the main
street, lined with shops brightly lit up for the festive season. The
pavement bustled with with people walking with a spring in their step
– the spring that the festive season, and all the love in the air
brought to you. Not that he noticed it, or had any of it in his step.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Soon, he's walking through the park. The park that was built to
celebrate time, ticking away, furiously. Or to celebrate the time
everyone in the world had, to enjoy themselves. He walked past the
skating rink, with lots of people having the time of their life ice
skating, and a lot more, awaiting their turn. The first timers, old
and young, making up for their inexperience, with their excitement;
holding onto whatever they can, to finish their next round, to start
their next. The veterans, taking the center-stage and showing off
their moves! He was barely aware of their presence and just walked on,
past all the action.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The music festival; he walked past it to, like the crowd didn't exist,
the noise didn't, the music didn't; like there was nothing happening!
The fountain "felt" no different. The cold breeze, did sprinkle the
water to quite a distance and everybody kept a safe distance to avoid
the chilling shower, except for the kids, who found it amusing to run
into the shower for a split second and run back madly. How could he
walk just by it, and not feel a thing!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The lakefront. That is where his legs always brought him, at the
end. The brilliantly lit skyline was a delight to watch, but I don't
believe he saw any of it. He just stared into it, blankly. He kept
staring, as the night got chillier, and the neighborhood kept getting
more and more deserted. Seconds ticked away, minutes and hours passed
by! He stayed on, staring ahead. It didn't matter how much below zero
the mercury had gone. This wasn't the first night he was spending
staring into the nothingness. It turned out to be the coldest night,
in a decade. But that didn't matter to him. Nothing did. Nothing has,
for a while now; Ever since he turned cold.

&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/avudem"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt; found a broken link referring to a one of my posts, on Quora.
Given that I have changed my site generator a bunch of times now, it
is quite possible that there are other broken links at various other
places.  So, I implemented a smart &lt;a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/this-is-a-fun-hack"&gt;404 page&lt;/a&gt; for the site, yesterday.
It is very similar to something I came across on &lt;a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/04/07/fun-with-intelligent-404-pages/"&gt;brettterpstra&lt;/a&gt;'s site.
I just &lt;a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/assets/js/suggestions.js"&gt;hooked up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kiro.me/projects/fuse.html"&gt;fuse.js&lt;/a&gt; with Nikola's &lt;a href="http://getnikola.com/handbook.html#local-search"&gt;tipue-search plugin&lt;/a&gt;'s output

the URL, performs a Fuse search on the json data created by Nikola's
search plugin, and returns a list of top 5 results.  It just took me
about an hour to write, but is pretty useful, I think.

pair programming with &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/114995175796183910458/posts"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; and it was an amazing learning
experience!  To share these lessons with my colleagues, I made a small
presentation at lunch, to my colleagues.  &lt;a href="https://rawgithub.com/punchagan/340e1350fdfc766c6599/raw/ca1f5fe9bfc1cc503cd8a524e350bd29e8f5f33d/month-with-martin.html"&gt;Here are the slides&lt;/a&gt; for the

&lt;p&gt;
The irony is this is actually what ancient philosophy was intended
to ameliorate. “Vain is the word of a philosopher,” Epicurus once
said, “which does not heal the suffering of man.” Centuries later,
Thoreau expressed this same thought: “To be a philosopher is not
merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school . . . it
is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically,
but practically.”
&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of people mistake flashy ultimate for “good” ultimate—they
think that chest-high layouts or 10-foot grabs in wolf packs are
hallmarks of the elite game. But I beg to differ. It’s true,
sometimes incredible feats of athleticism are the only way to save a
possession or get a block—and they aren’t easy to execute. Still,
it’s the most mundane things that often make the biggest impacts on
the field.

There is a time and a place for reflection and contemplation about
the greater universe. Now, I know I sound like a hypocrite because I
do write about these things a lot, but I’ll tell you now, as someone
who does over-think it, sometimes you just have to let it be what it
is and not become overwhelmed by the vastness, mysteriousness and
unknown possibility that lies around us. It can be more debilitating
than inspiring sometimes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Deep down, many of us wonder if we’re wasting our time on things of
little consequence. So we keep skittering along the surface at a
feverish pace, avoiding the mirror of introspection.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I’ve found recently that when the time is used well, slowness can
actually be one of the most profound sources of abundance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And on the positive side, sometimes entrepreneurs work on their
businesses after hours out of love, rather than straining toward an
overly-optimistic deadline out of fear. I’ve been there, I’ve put in
the hours and I’ll do it again. But not unless I’m motivated by
love.

and who it’s for. I’m not an official source of information; for
that, I recommend the User’s Manual and this blog post. Having said
that, here are a few things I’ve heard people say that attest to
misconceptions about Hacker School, and my responses to them.

From Angelo’s blog: “I remember the exact moment…Jen’s voice and the
numb feeling that enveloped me. That feeling has never left. I’ll
also never forget how we looked into each other’s eyes and held each
other’s hands. ‘We are together, we’ll be ok.’”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Throughout her battle, Angelo decided to photograph it. He wanted to
humanize  the face of cancer on the face of his wife. The photos
speak for themselves.

&lt;p&gt;
It takes 10,000 hours to become an “expert in an ultra competitive
field” but to go from “knowing nothing to being pretty good”,
actually takes 20 hours. The equivalent of 45 minutes a day for a
month.

&lt;p&gt;
We're one month into the second year of Catalyst, an after-school
tech/computer class that I run for kids aged 9-13, and this year
I've decided to try something different. [Last year, I had the kids
learn in a browser-based / console-like IDE that I created - kind of
like CodeAcademy, but ultimately it was just too much work to
maintain and too limiting]. My new plan is to teach the kids how to
build their own interactive websites from scratch using HTML, CSS
and Javascript, and to do it on their own Linux VPS (CentOS 6) using
Vim. I know it probably sounds crazy, but if the preliminary
reception and results are any indication, I think it's going to be a
success.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here is a fun bucket list of the places you simply have to visit
before you turn thirty. They are not just destinations but also
crazy experiences that will go down the book of your memory
lane. From treading on Living Root Bridges in Cherrapunji to a bike
ride through Ladakh, trekking through the valley of flowers in
Himalayas to surfing in Orissa, here are some insane experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;

I used to have a separate page for bookmarks and quotes on the old
blog.  They will now be shared as regular posts with 5 or more
bookmarks/quotes.  I use a bookmarklet in my browser to capture links
to an org-file using org-capture protocol and then I have a small
plugin to Nikola, that looks at such captured bookmarks and quotes and
makes new posts out of them.  This workflow is inspired by Brett
Trepestra's &lt;a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/01/15/a-web-excursions-system-for-static-blogs/"&gt;web excursions&lt;/a&gt; plugin.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The plugin is currently a part of my blog source, and not published to
Nikola's plugin repository since it is very specific to my setup.  But
if anybody is interested, I can publish the code somewhere public.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are interested to get these links and bookmarks into your feed
reader, you can subscribe to their feed: &lt;a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/categories/quotes.xml"&gt;quotes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/categories/bookmarks.xml"&gt;bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;.  These
posts will also make it to the main feed, though.
