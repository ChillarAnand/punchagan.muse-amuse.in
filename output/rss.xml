it is not every day that you get to play against someone with 13000

If you have legacy code in MATLAB, then it may make sense to just
continue using it. If it works, don’t fix it. However, if your
Matlab code keeps causing you pain, Python might be a solution.

We're one month into the second year of Catalyst, an after-school
tech/computer class that I run for kids aged 9-13, and this year
I've decided to try something different. [Last year, I had the kids
learn in a browser-based / console-like IDE that I created - kind of
like CodeAcademy, but ultimately it was just too much work to
maintain and too limiting]. My new plan is to teach the kids how to
build their own interactive websites from scratch using HTML, CSS
and Javascript, and to do it on their own Linux VPS (CentOS 6) using
Vim. I know it probably sounds crazy, but if the preliminary
reception and results are any indication, I think it's going to be a
success.
&lt;/li&gt;

Here is a fun bucket list of the places you simply have to visit
before you turn thirty. They are not just destinations but also
crazy experiences that will go down the book of your memory
lane. From treading on Living Root Bridges in Cherrapunji to a bike
ride through Ladakh, trekking through the valley of flowers in
Himalayas to surfing in Orissa, here are some insane experiences.
&lt;/li&gt;

I used to have a separate page for bookmarks and quotes on the old
blog.  They will now be shared as regular posts with 5 or more
bookmarks/quotes.  I use a bookmarklet in my browser to capture links
to an org-file using org-capture protocol and then I have a small
plugin to Nikola, that looks at such captured bookmarks and quotes and
makes new posts out of them.  This workflow is inspired by Brett
Trepestra's &lt;a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/01/15/a-web-excursions-system-for-static-blogs/"&gt;web excursions&lt;/a&gt; plugin.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The plugin is currently a part of my blog source, and not published to
Nikola's plugin repository since it is very specific to my setup.  But
if anybody is interested, I can publish the code somewhere public.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are interested to get these links and bookmarks into your feed
reader, you can subscribe to their feed: &lt;a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/categories/quotes.xml"&gt;quotes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/categories/bookmarks.xml"&gt;bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;.  These
posts will also make it to the main feed, though.

As a rough estimate, 95% of functions in any code base should be so

&lt;p&gt;
So I have just one wish for you–the good luck to be somewhere where
you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and
where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in
the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your
integrity. May you have that freedom.

&lt;p&gt;
The best explanation I was ever given (and maybe one of the biggest

Sigh! I made yet another change to the way this blog gets published.
But, I have a feeling this mechanism, is here to stay!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We've been using Nikola quite regularly for our &lt;a href="http://ultimatesport.in"&gt;Ultimate site&lt;/a&gt;, and I
quite like it.  I've also contributed a bunch of features to Nikola to
get it to work the way I would like it to.  This weekend I ported my
blog from &lt;a href="https://github.com/renard/o-blog"&gt;o-blog&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://getnikola.com"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;.  The only thing that was stopping me
from doing it, until now is the fact that all my posts are in
org markup and porting them over to one of the formats that Nikola
supports would be a PITA.  So, I wrote a &lt;a href="http://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode"&gt;pretty simple plugin&lt;/a&gt; to
Nikola to support posting from org files.  And then with a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/6970578"&gt;little
Python&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to move everything over to use Nikola.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hopefully, I'll keep my blog more updated, from here on!

questions of purpose, value, efficacy, and self-worth. It is these
questions, not the answers, that endure and unify.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/modern%20art%20vs%20toddler%20art/"&gt;QUIZ: Modern Art or Children’s Drawings? | Bored Panda&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
:art:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Art, and what we do and do not consider to be art, has changed a lot
over the last century. It has become an increasingly difficult thing
to define for the average person, and sometimes even art historians
and experts can’t seem to keep up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This was illustrated in a 2005 survey done by ABC News in which
modern masters’ works were mixed into a series with paintings done
by children and toddlers. Regular people and art critics alike were
asked to choose from the series – which of these works belong in a
museum and which ones don’t? Now, Buzzfeed has released a similar
survey as well, which we’ve expanded on a bit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The results of that survey indicate that either we have a long way
to go before we can define what is and isn’t modern art, or that
there’s no need to define it so strictly in the first
place. Whatever the case may be, let’s see if you’re any better at
telling modern art from children’s drawings than the experts are!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is
then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We
should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner
spirit.  – &lt;i&gt;Albert Schweitzer, 1875 - 1965&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Anyone who cannot cope with mathematics is not fully human.  At best
he is a tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe and
not make messes in the house.  – &lt;i&gt;Lazarus Long, Time Enough for
Love&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you
could know how seldom they do. – &lt;i&gt;Olin Miller&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you judge people, you have no time to love them. – &lt;i&gt;Mother Teresa&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
and not giving it. – &lt;i&gt;William Arthur Ward&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
Where the mind is without fear and the head held high;&lt;br&gt;
Where knowledge is free;&lt;br&gt;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;&lt;br&gt;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;&lt;br&gt;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;&lt;br&gt;
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;&lt;br&gt;
Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action;&lt;br&gt;
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Rabindranath Tagore – Let My Country Awake&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The true Enlightenment thinker, the true rationalist, never wants to
talk anyone into anything. No, he does not even want to convince;
all the time he is aware that he may be wrong. Above all, he values
the intellectual independence of others too highly to want to
convince them in important matters. He would much rather invite
contradiction, preferably in the form of rational and disciplined
criticism. He seeks not to convince but to arouse — to challenge
others to form free opinions. – &lt;i&gt;Karl Popper – On Freedom&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Don't ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you
come alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is
people who have come alive. – &lt;i&gt;Howard Thurman&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't

&lt;li&gt;Furious activity is no substitute for understanding. –
  &lt;i&gt;H.H. Williams – Activity&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet,
balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take
orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze
a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal,
fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.  –
&lt;i&gt;Robert A. Heinlein – Human Beings&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced — even a proverb is
no proverb to you till your life has illustrated it. – &lt;i&gt;John Keats&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We lie loudest when we lie to ourselves. – &lt;i&gt;Eric Hoffer&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The first hour of the morning is the rudder of the day. – &lt;i&gt;Henry
Ward Beecher&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally

I am unread.  Unlike you, who classify yourselves as well-read or
not, I am classified as unread or not.  Well, you could call me
not well-read too, I guess.  I was looked at once, my innards
glanced through, and was hurriedly marked as unread, starred and
tagged.  Given my length, the care with which I was composed, and
the flurry with which I was stowed away, I probably contain
something important, to be read at the opportune moment, something
to be cherished and to be replied to with diligence and care.  I
felt a sense of pride.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I got composed and sent weeks ago, and have been lying here
untouched, since.  I get buried deeper and deeper every day, with
a daily flood of newer stuff piling up onto me.  While my
composer, eagerly awaits a reply, (less and less eagerly each day,
though) I have lost all hope of being read and replied to.  I
curse myself for carrying something so important.  A thousand
other replies have been sent, and a few thousand others composed
here, but my turn hasn't come, yet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How I wish, it'd be my turn today.  How I wish, I could push my
way up through to the top of the stack.  How I wish, I could see
the eager wait come to an end!  How I wish, I'm given the
attention I deserved, today!  Reply, ASAP!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
PS: Apologies for all those emails that are still starred and
unread, in my Inbox…
