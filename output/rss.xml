People ask what is the meaning of life, as if there is a single

ones. A life will be meaningful if it finds responses to the four
questions of purpose, value, efficacy, and self-worth. It is these
questions, not the answers, that endure and unify.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/modern%20art%20vs%20toddler%20art/"&gt;QUIZ: Modern Art or Children’s Drawings? | Bored Panda&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
:art:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Art, and what we do and do not consider to be art, has changed a lot
over the last century. It has become an increasingly difficult thing
to define for the average person, and sometimes even art historians
and experts can’t seem to keep up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This was illustrated in a 2005 survey done by ABC News in which
modern masters’ works were mixed into a series with paintings done
by children and toddlers. Regular people and art critics alike were
asked to choose from the series – which of these works belong in a
museum and which ones don’t? Now, Buzzfeed has released a similar
survey as well, which we’ve expanded on a bit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The results of that survey indicate that either we have a long way
to go before we can define what is and isn’t modern art, or that
there’s no need to define it so strictly in the first
place. Whatever the case may be, let’s see if you’re any better at
telling modern art from children’s drawings than the experts are!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is
then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We
should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner
spirit.  – &lt;i&gt;Albert Schweitzer, 1875 - 1965&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Anyone who cannot cope with mathematics is not fully human.  At best
he is a tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe and
not make messes in the house.  – &lt;i&gt;Lazarus Long, Time Enough for
Love&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you
could know how seldom they do. – &lt;i&gt;Olin Miller&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you judge people, you have no time to love them. – &lt;i&gt;Mother Teresa&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
and not giving it. – &lt;i&gt;William Arthur Ward&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
Where the mind is without fear and the head held high;&lt;br&gt;
Where knowledge is free;&lt;br&gt;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;&lt;br&gt;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;&lt;br&gt;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;&lt;br&gt;
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;&lt;br&gt;
Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action;&lt;br&gt;
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Rabindranath Tagore – Let My Country Awake&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The true Enlightenment thinker, the true rationalist, never wants to
talk anyone into anything. No, he does not even want to convince;
all the time he is aware that he may be wrong. Above all, he values
the intellectual independence of others too highly to want to
convince them in important matters. He would much rather invite
contradiction, preferably in the form of rational and disciplined
criticism. He seeks not to convince but to arouse — to challenge
others to form free opinions. – &lt;i&gt;Karl Popper – On Freedom&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Don't ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you
come alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is
people who have come alive. – &lt;i&gt;Howard Thurman&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't
hurt. – &lt;i&gt;Charles M Schultz&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Furious activity is no substitute for understanding. –
  &lt;i&gt;H.H. Williams – Activity&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet,
balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take
orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze
a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal,
fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.  –
&lt;i&gt;Robert A. Heinlein – Human Beings&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced — even a proverb is
no proverb to you till your life has illustrated it. – &lt;i&gt;John Keats&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We lie loudest when we lie to ourselves. – &lt;i&gt;Eric Hoffer&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The first hour of the morning is the rudder of the day. – &lt;i&gt;Henry
Ward Beecher&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally
for machines to execute. – &lt;i&gt;Abelson &amp;amp; Sussman – SICP, preface to
the first edition&lt;/i&gt;

I am unread.  Unlike you, who classify yourselves as well-read or
not, I am classified as unread or not.  Well, you could call me
not well-read too, I guess.  I was looked at once, my innards
glanced through, and was hurriedly marked as unread, starred and
tagged.  Given my length, the care with which I was composed, and
the flurry with which I was stowed away, I probably contain
something important, to be read at the opportune moment, something
to be cherished and to be replied to with diligence and care.  I
felt a sense of pride.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I got composed and sent weeks ago, and have been lying here
untouched, since.  I get buried deeper and deeper every day, with
a daily flood of newer stuff piling up onto me.  While my
composer, eagerly awaits a reply, (less and less eagerly each day,
though) I have lost all hope of being read and replied to.  I
curse myself for carrying something so important.  A thousand
other replies have been sent, and a few thousand others composed
here, but my turn hasn't come, yet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How I wish, it'd be my turn today.  How I wish, I could push my
way up through to the top of the stack.  How I wish, I could see
the eager wait come to an end!  How I wish, I'm given the
attention I deserved, today!  Reply, ASAP!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
PS: Apologies for all those emails that are still starred and
unread, in my Inbox…

About 20 of us, gathered at Andheri Station, to leave for Surat.
I was the only one playing in his/her first tournament, and it was
exciting to be a part of a squad, going to a tournament.  A first
in my life.  We had two teams, A and B, or better known as Storm
and Chasers.  I was playing for the Chasers team.  The train
journey was pretty uneventful for me, unfortunately so, because of
a mixed up ticket booking and only 4 of us, sitting in the AC
coach.  I ended up reading or sleeping for most part of the
journey.  I didn't realize, we could just walk into the other
coach where most of the others were having a lot of fun!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fountainhead School was the venue for the tournament, and they
had arranged for transport, accommodation and food and drinks,
all through the tournament.  The organization for the tournament
was pretty good, I must say!  We had a bus pick us up at the
railway station, and getting into the bus felt like we were some
big team with our own team bus, and stuff (though, there was also
the Silent Voice team on the bus ;).  Ganesh and I had a little
chat in the bus, and he was recollecting his experiences in his
first tournament, and was asking me what I expected from the
tournament, and I didn't really have a good answer, because I was
too excited.  But, I really enjoyed the chat with him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We all crashed at the school library for the night, for a hard day
in the field on the next day.  We rushed to the field, early next
morning, about half a km of walk from the school, the playing
field was in the middle of some fields and we warmed up to a
lovely sun rise.  Storm had their first game at 7, against Dream
Catchers, and they started a little rusty in the first half, but
came back strongly in the second one to beat them 11-7.  This was
going to be closest their opposition was going to come to winning!
Chasers had their first game against Silent Voice, a team from
Ahmedabad.  We got together as a team for the first time, really,
and having just one substitute player didn't really help much.  We
got thrashed by Silent voice, 11-4 or 11-5.  Chasers got the next
game as a bye, since Lay Lapak failed to turn up for the
tournament and this meant we slid up the table and got to play the
Dream Catchers from Ahmedabad.  Craig reached in time, from
Mumbai, for this game, and we gave them a decent fight in this
game, though the score line didn't really suggest it.  We were
doing way too many mistakes (and repeating them!) near the
end-zones and they were costing us a lot.  The highlight of these
games, though, was the spectacular layouts by Cheerag on D. Storm,
meanwhile, thrashed the HAT team 11-0, and beat Surat Trailblazers
convincingly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A lot of the teams had school kids on them, who were playing
astonishingly well.  The pick out of those was Jumbish, which had
10 to 15 year olds, jumping all over the place and giving their
opposition a run for their money.  The moment of the tournament
for me was a catch by a Jumbish player, who jumped ahead of him,
to take a catch, flipped over in the air without placing his hands
on to the ground, and landed on his feet and made a perfectly nice
pass to his team-mate!  Exciting stuff to watch!  Pune also has a
nice Ultimate program for kids, and their team Royal Spirits was
playing some good Ultimate.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The last game of the day was Storm vs. Flying Spirits from Pune,
who were second on the points table, after Storm.  But Storm was
clinical in their execution, and "Bagel-ed" [read as, thrashed
11-0] Flying Spirits.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day, we had a good dinner and lots of ice-cream
and discussed our favorite moments of the day.  I felt proud to
have featured in atleast one person's favorite moments, in my
first tournament! W00t!  Some of us fooled around on the dance
floor for a while, to some Gujarati and Bollywood music.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The next day started with us playing Royal Spirits (Pune).  We
started off strongly, but ended up giving away some easy scores
towards the end of the game, and ended up drawing the game at 6
all.  Our next game against Storm was another Bagel for Storm.
They played zone on us, and though we were as patient as we could
be, we simply didn't have enough skill and team work to score
against them.  Our next game against Flying Spirits was a very
good game, and I'd rate it the best amongst our games.  We played
a good stack and played hard on D, and were able to keep the
scores at 5-5 until the last 5 minutes, when they scored and
finished winners.  The Flying Spirits admitted to us giving them a
good competition and making them work hard for their goals.  Our
last game was against Zero Gravity, a team from the school
itself, and our first victory!  We started off pretty strongly,
and were able to finish the game 10-5.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The final between Storm and Cats-Dogs (Delhi) was so much fun to
watch.  Storm stuck to their clinical performance and everyone
seemed to be playing at their best!  They came out winners 13-4
in a game that lasted close to an hour and a half.  All the other
games, btw, were games-to-11 and time capped to 55 minutes.
Storm also managed to win the Spirit award for the tournament,
and it is the first time in Indian Ultimate's history that a team
won both the tournament and the spirit award!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The tournament was a lot of fun and a lot of learning for me.  I
learnt a lot of things from everyone playing there, specially from
the players in Storm.  I know I'll carry forward some wonderful
memories from my first tournament, thanks to everyone from Storm
Chasers and everybody else, who I played against.  I really liked
the idea of spirit circles after the games, where each team
discussed the game and appreciated the other team about particular
aspects of their team and play and suggested areas that they could
work on, to improve themselves.  I also hung out around some of
the spirit circles of Storm and their opposition and I really
loved listening to Apu speak to the opposition.  On almost every
occasion, it gave me goosebumps!  Thanks Apu, for showing us, what
the spirit of the game should mean to each of us.  Ganesh
mentioned, in the chat we had on the bus to the school, that I'd
learn a lot more than just Ultimate, and it turned out to be true.
I got to learn a lot about my team, and everybody on Storm
chasers.  I experienced what it feels like, to be a part of a
squad or a team, for the first time and it feels great, in short!
Thanks Ganesh for the chat, and all the inspiration on-and-off the
field.  In the middle of one of the games, Willis walked up to me
and told me to be more confident on the field and move more
crisply on the field.  I'm not sure, that will change in one game,
but that is something I'll remember for a long time to come.
Kayleigh reminded me of one of the good catches I took on day-1,
by having it in her favorite moments of the day.  As someone
playing in his first tournament, that's a pretty big deal!  Thanks
to Willis and Kayleigh for all the encouragement, guidance and
training!  Thanks to Parag for drilling it into our team, that we
are going to keep the game's tempo high, but our tempers low.  The
tournament was much more fun, that way.  Thanks to Robo for giving
me the cleats, and the encouragement during many a practice
session.  Thanks to Rose for being the wonderful captain that she
was, thanks to Cheerag for showing us how much one can give on D,
thanks to Craig, Diti, Rakesh, Sheryll and Vishal for being
supportive and being patient with me and all my blunders.  Thanks
to Pixie for all the morning practice sessions, while we were
waiting for everyone else to turn up.  Thanks to Mak for help from
the shouting helping me out from the side lines.  Thanks to Jimmy,
Megna, and Sarah, for making me feel a part of the squad, and for
being a part of the wonderful Storm!  Here are some pictures,
thanks to Shantanu and Saurabh, who traveled all the way to Surat
to watch, cheer and capture!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even if, our team won just one out of the 6 games we played, it
was an Ultimate tourney.  Literally!  Looking forward to future
tournaments.

You will mess up.  I will take away your phone.  We will sit down and talk about it.  We will start over again.  You &amp;amp; I, we are always learning.  I am on your team.  We are in this together.

Shantanu and I gave a short talk titled "Software Carpentry for
Scientists" for the graduate students of Chemical Engineering
department, IISc, this Friday.  We gave a short introduction to
Git, TDD, Numpy/Scipy, etc and mentioned a few things from Greg
Wilson et al's paper.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I promised to revert to them with links to a few resources.  I
figured it would be more beneficial, if I just put it in a
publicly available place.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A summary of the paper by Greg Wilson et. al., is below.

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write programs for people, not computers
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a program should not require its readers to hold more than a
handful of facts in memory at once.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;names should be consistent, distinctive and meaningful.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code style and formatting should be consistent.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all aspects of software development should be broken down
into tasks roughly an hour long
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate repetitive tasks
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rely on the computer to repeat tasks
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;save recent commands in a file for re-use
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a build to automate scientific work-flows
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the computer to record history
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;software tools should be used to track computational work
automatically.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make incremental changes
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work in small steps with frequent feedback and course
correction
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use version control
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a version control system
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything that has been created manually should be put in
version control
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't repeat yourself (or others)
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every piece of data must have a single authoritative
representation in the system
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code should be modularized rather than copied and pasted
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;re-use code instead of rewriting it
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan for mistakes
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add assertions to programs to check their operation
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use an off-the-shelf unit testing library
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use all available oracles when testing programs
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn bugs into test cases
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a symbolic debugger
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize software only after it works correctly
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a profiler to identify bottlenecks
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write code in the highest-level language possible
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document design and purpose, not mechanics
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document interfaces and reasons, not implementations
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refactor code instead of explaining how it works
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;embed the documentation for a piece of software in that software
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use pre-merge code reviews
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use pair programming when bringing someone new up to speed
and when tackling particularly tricky problems
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use an issue tracking tool
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.
&lt;/p&gt;
