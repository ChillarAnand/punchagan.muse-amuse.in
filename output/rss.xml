&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://amitbanerjee.net/complacency/"&gt;When Success Comes To You Easily | Amitbanerjee.net&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The biggest trap that you can fall into is if you can be successful
without giving your 100 percent in whatever you are doing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's my advice for Lucy:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay wildly ambitious. The current world is bubbling with
opportunity for an ambitious person to find flowery, fulfilling
success. The specific direction may be unclear, but it'll work
itself out – just dive in somewhere.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Stop thinking that you're special. The fact is, right now, you're
not special. You're another completely inexperienced young person
who doesn't have all that much to offer yet. You can become
special by working really hard for a long time.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ignore everyone else. Other people's grass seeming greener is no
new concept, but in today's image crafting world, other people's
grass looks like a glorious meadow. The truth is that everyone
else is just as indecisive, self-doubting, and frustrated as you
are, and if you just do your thing, you'll never have any reason
to envy others.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

It was a pleasant Saturday evening, in the middle of the winter.
Christmas was just round the corner and love, in the air. The sun was
just setting, and everything outside his window was given a fresh coat
of snow, tickled by the red, quickly fading light. Not that he
noticed. He stared blankly out of the window, looking at nothing in
particular. He had just woke up from his afternoon nap, but he'd buy
it, if you told him he'd been sleeping for a year…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You could see the icy river, crawling ahead, from his window.  People
walking over the bridge, a few camera flashes going off, people
stopping over and looking far ahead into the horizon, collecting their
thoughts, couples walking hand-in-hand enjoying each others'
company… You could see it all, from up there! But, as they say, you
only see what you look for. And he, couldn't see any of this. His
looked out of his window, and saw none of this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He is walking down the same bridge. He didn't know where he was going;
his head at least. His legs did; as always. He was walking down in his
regular yellow shirt and black jeans, that you could mistake for a
uniform, if you followed him for a few days. Extremely under-dressed
for the chilly night, one would say. He kept walking down the main
street, lined with shops brightly lit up for the festive season. The
pavement bustled with with people walking with a spring in their step
– the spring that the festive season, and all the love in the air
brought to you. Not that he noticed it, or had any of it in his step.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Soon, he's walking through the park. The park that was built to
celebrate time, ticking away, furiously. Or to celebrate the time
everyone in the world had, to enjoy themselves. He walked past the
skating rink, with lots of people having the time of their life ice
skating, and a lot more, awaiting their turn. The first timers, old
and young, making up for their inexperience, with their excitement;
holding onto whatever they can, to finish their next round, to start
their next. The veterans, taking the center-stage and showing off
their moves! He was barely aware of their presence and just walked on,
past all the action.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The music festival; he walked past it to, like the crowd didn't exist,
the noise didn't, the music didn't; like there was nothing happening!
The fountain "felt" no different. The cold breeze, did sprinkle the
water to quite a distance and everybody kept a safe distance to avoid
the chilling shower, except for the kids, who found it amusing to run
into the shower for a split second and run back madly. How could he
walk just by it, and not feel a thing!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The lakefront. That is where his legs always brought him, at the
end. The brilliantly lit skyline was a delight to watch, but I don't
believe he saw any of it. He just stared into it, blankly. He kept
staring, as the night got chillier, and the neighborhood kept getting
more and more deserted. Seconds ticked away, minutes and hours passed
by! He stayed on, staring ahead. It didn't matter how much below zero
the mercury had gone. This wasn't the first night he was spending
staring into the nothingness. It turned out to be the coldest night,
in a decade. But that didn't matter to him. Nothing did. Nothing has,
for a while now; Ever since he turned cold.

&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/avudem"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt; found a broken link referring to a one of my posts, on Quora.
Given that I have changed my site generator a bunch of times now, it
is quite possible that there are other broken links at various other
places.  So, I implemented a smart &lt;a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/this-is-a-fun-hack"&gt;404 page&lt;/a&gt; for the site, yesterday.
It is very similar to something I came across on &lt;a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/04/07/fun-with-intelligent-404-pages/"&gt;brettterpstra&lt;/a&gt;'s site.
I just &lt;a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/assets/js/suggestions.js"&gt;hooked up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kiro.me/projects/fuse.html"&gt;fuse.js&lt;/a&gt; with Nikola's &lt;a href="http://getnikola.com/handbook.html#local-search"&gt;tipue-search plugin&lt;/a&gt;'s output

the URL, performs a Fuse search on the json data created by Nikola's
search plugin, and returns a list of top 5 results.  It just took me
about an hour to write, but is pretty useful, I think.

&lt;p&gt;
The irony is this is actually what ancient philosophy was intended
to ameliorate. “Vain is the word of a philosopher,” Epicurus once
said, “which does not heal the suffering of man.” Centuries later,
Thoreau expressed this same thought: “To be a philosopher is not
merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school . . . it
is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically,
but practically.”

A lot of people mistake flashy ultimate for “good” ultimate—they
think that chest-high layouts or 10-foot grabs in wolf packs are
hallmarks of the elite game. But I beg to differ. It’s true,
sometimes incredible feats of athleticism are the only way to save a
possession or get a block—and they aren’t easy to execute. Still,
it’s the most mundane things that often make the biggest impacts on
the field.

There is a time and a place for reflection and contemplation about
the greater universe. Now, I know I sound like a hypocrite because I
do write about these things a lot, but I’ll tell you now, as someone
who does over-think it, sometimes you just have to let it be what it
is and not become overwhelmed by the vastness, mysteriousness and
unknown possibility that lies around us. It can be more debilitating
than inspiring sometimes.

Deep down, many of us wonder if we’re wasting our time on things of
little consequence. So we keep skittering along the surface at a
feverish pace, avoiding the mirror of introspection.

I’ve found recently that when the time is used well, slowness can
actually be one of the most profound sources of abundance.
&lt;/p&gt;

And on the positive side, sometimes entrepreneurs work on their
businesses after hours out of love, rather than straining toward an

the hours and I’ll do it again. But not unless I’m motivated by
love.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net/"&gt;Static Site Generators&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The definitive listing of Static Site Generators — all 200 of them!

My lad wouldn't like it all. He is fearless. Just like his mother.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.viralnova.com/wifes-cancer/"&gt;This Guy Photographed Every Stage Of His Wife's Cancer. The Last 3 Photos Destroyed Me.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From Angelo’s blog: “I remember the exact moment…Jen’s voice and the
numb feeling that enveloped me. That feeling has never left. I’ll
also never forget how we looked into each other’s eyes and held each
other’s hands. ‘We are together, we’ll be ok.’”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Throughout her battle, Angelo decided to photograph it. He wanted to
humanize  the face of cancer on the face of his wife. The photos
speak for themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2013/10/24/doesnt-take-10000-hours-learn-skill-takes-20-heres-now/"&gt;It doesn’t take 10,000 hours to learn a new skill. It takes 20. And here’s how…   The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It takes 10,000 hours to become an “expert in an ultra competitive
field” but to go from “knowing nothing to being pretty good”,
actually takes 20 hours. The equivalent of 45 minutes a day for a
month.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
UN Women uses real Google searches to highlight Global Sexism: The
campaign uses the world's most popular search engine (Google) to
show how gender inequality is a worldwide problem. The adverts show
the results of genuine searches, highlighting popular opinions
across the world wide web
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

My commute is a journey. A journey toward finding the right balance
between the two cities. This is Bangalore. The city offers you
everything you need and sits back and watches while you imprudently
pick only what you want.
&lt;/p&gt;
