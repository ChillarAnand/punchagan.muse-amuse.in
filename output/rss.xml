&lt;p&gt;
The irony is this is actually what ancient philosophy was intended
to ameliorate. “Vain is the word of a philosopher,” Epicurus once
said, “which does not heal the suffering of man.” Centuries later,
Thoreau expressed this same thought: “To be a philosopher is not
merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school . . . it
is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically,
but practically.”
&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of people mistake flashy ultimate for “good” ultimate—they
think that chest-high layouts or 10-foot grabs in wolf packs are
hallmarks of the elite game. But I beg to differ. It’s true,
sometimes incredible feats of athleticism are the only way to save a
possession or get a block—and they aren’t easy to execute. Still,
it’s the most mundane things that often make the biggest impacts on
the field.

&lt;p&gt;
There is a time and a place for reflection and contemplation about
the greater universe. Now, I know I sound like a hypocrite because I
do write about these things a lot, but I’ll tell you now, as someone
who does over-think it, sometimes you just have to let it be what it
is and not become overwhelmed by the vastness, mysteriousness and
unknown possibility that lies around us. It can be more debilitating
than inspiring sometimes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Deep down, many of us wonder if we’re wasting our time on things of
little consequence. So we keep skittering along the surface at a
feverish pace, avoiding the mirror of introspection.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I’ve found recently that when the time is used well, slowness can
actually be one of the most profound sources of abundance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And on the positive side, sometimes entrepreneurs work on their
businesses after hours out of love, rather than straining toward an
overly-optimistic deadline out of fear. I’ve been there, I’ve put in
the hours and I’ll do it again. But not unless I’m motivated by
love.

&lt;p&gt;
I’ve encountered a few misconceptions about what Hacker School is
and who it’s for. I’m not an official source of information; for
that, I recommend the User’s Manual and this blog post. Having said
that, here are a few things I’ve heard people say that attest to
misconceptions about Hacker School, and my responses to them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From Angelo’s blog: “I remember the exact moment…Jen’s voice and the
numb feeling that enveloped me. That feeling has never left. I’ll
also never forget how we looked into each other’s eyes and held each
other’s hands. ‘We are together, we’ll be ok.’”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Throughout her battle, Angelo decided to photograph it. He wanted to
humanize  the face of cancer on the face of his wife. The photos
speak for themselves.

&lt;p&gt;
It takes 10,000 hours to become an “expert in an ultra competitive
field” but to go from “knowing nothing to being pretty good”,
actually takes 20 hours. The equivalent of 45 minutes a day for a
month.

If you have legacy code in MATLAB, then it may make sense to just
continue using it. If it works, don’t fix it. However, if your

&lt;p&gt;
We're one month into the second year of Catalyst, an after-school
tech/computer class that I run for kids aged 9-13, and this year
I've decided to try something different. [Last year, I had the kids
learn in a browser-based / console-like IDE that I created - kind of
like CodeAcademy, but ultimately it was just too much work to
maintain and too limiting]. My new plan is to teach the kids how to
build their own interactive websites from scratch using HTML, CSS
and Javascript, and to do it on their own Linux VPS (CentOS 6) using
Vim. I know it probably sounds crazy, but if the preliminary
reception and results are any indication, I think it's going to be a
success.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here is a fun bucket list of the places you simply have to visit
before you turn thirty. They are not just destinations but also
crazy experiences that will go down the book of your memory
lane. From treading on Living Root Bridges in Cherrapunji to a bike
ride through Ladakh, trekking through the valley of flowers in
Himalayas to surfing in Orissa, here are some insane experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;

I used to have a separate page for bookmarks and quotes on the old
blog.  They will now be shared as regular posts with 5 or more
bookmarks/quotes.  I use a bookmarklet in my browser to capture links
to an org-file using org-capture protocol and then I have a small
plugin to Nikola, that looks at such captured bookmarks and quotes and
makes new posts out of them.  This workflow is inspired by Brett
Trepestra's &lt;a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/01/15/a-web-excursions-system-for-static-blogs/"&gt;web excursions&lt;/a&gt; plugin.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The plugin is currently a part of my blog source, and not published to
Nikola's plugin repository since it is very specific to my setup.  But
if anybody is interested, I can publish the code somewhere public.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are interested to get these links and bookmarks into your feed
reader, you can subscribe to their feed: &lt;a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/categories/quotes.xml"&gt;quotes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/categories/bookmarks.xml"&gt;bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;.  These
posts will also make it to the main feed, though.

Sigh! I made yet another change to the way this blog gets published.
But, I have a feeling this mechanism, is here to stay!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We've been using Nikola quite regularly for our &lt;a href="http://ultimatesport.in"&gt;Ultimate site&lt;/a&gt;, and I
quite like it.  I've also contributed a bunch of features to Nikola to
get it to work the way I would like it to.  This weekend I ported my
blog from &lt;a href="https://github.com/renard/o-blog"&gt;o-blog&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://getnikola.com"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;.  The only thing that was stopping me
from doing it, until now is the fact that all my posts are in
org markup and porting them over to one of the formats that Nikola
supports would be a PITA.  So, I wrote a &lt;a href="http://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode"&gt;pretty simple plugin&lt;/a&gt; to
Nikola to support posting from org files.  And then with a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/6970578"&gt;little
Python&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to move everything over to use Nikola.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hopefully, I'll keep my blog more updated, from here on!

Imagine a search engine that simply removed the top 1 million most
popular web sites from its index. What would you discover?

&lt;p&gt;
People ask what is the meaning of life, as if there is a single
answer. There is no one answer: there are thousands of different
ones. A life will be meaningful if it finds responses to the four
questions of purpose, value, efficacy, and self-worth. It is these
questions, not the answers, that endure and unify.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Art, and what we do and do not consider to be art, has changed a lot
over the last century. It has become an increasingly difficult thing
to define for the average person, and sometimes even art historians
and experts can’t seem to keep up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This was illustrated in a 2005 survey done by ABC News in which
modern masters’ works were mixed into a series with paintings done
by children and toddlers. Regular people and art critics alike were
asked to choose from the series – which of these works belong in a
museum and which ones don’t? Now, Buzzfeed has released a similar
survey as well, which we’ve expanded on a bit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The results of that survey indicate that either we have a long way
to go before we can define what is and isn’t modern art, or that
there’s no need to define it so strictly in the first
place. Whatever the case may be, let’s see if you’re any better at
telling modern art from children’s drawings than the experts are!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
