To help myself read more books, I plan to keep a list of the books I have
read. I hope that making it public will lead to --
1. some social pressure on me to keep reading
2. interesting conversations about books I have read, and should read! Drop me
   an email or ping me on [[https://punchagan.com/twitter][Twitter]].
