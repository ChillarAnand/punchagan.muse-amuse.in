Noetic Nought is punchagan's home on the web. He records his experiences and
feelings through his journey of life [[./posts/index.html][here]]. He loves creating things by making
computers flip bits, chasing flying Frisbees and long walks or bike rides. He's
also interested in learning to learn better, and express his ideas better.

punchagan collects his favorite quotes [[./quotes.html][here]], and look [[./tags/cat_bookmarks.html][here]] to find the kind of
stuff he reads and likes.  He went to [[http://recurse.com][the Recurse Center]] (previously known as
Hacker School) in the Summer of 2014 and [[./tags/cat_recursecenter-checkins.html][loved]] it.

He occasionally tweets [[https://twitter.com/punchagan][here]], and you can find his code [[https://github.com/punchagan][here]]. You can email him
at punchagan at this domain.
