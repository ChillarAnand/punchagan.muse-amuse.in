<li>I spent about an hour in the morning testing out the staging blaggregator
instance, and things seemed to work as expected.  Side note, I got added as a
collaborator on the blaggregator repo!
</li>
<li>We worked through the first chapter on getting video working, but we mostly
ended up just copying code rather than actually understanding/carefully
studying it.  I'm not sure how I feel about it, but we got to display fancy
stuff.
</li>
<li>I wasn't feeling like working on any of my 'old'/'ongoing' projects, and
since Mondays don't feel very productive, I worked on writing a couple of
simple scripts to create twitter lists of HSers, batch wise.

<p>
For the HS API, I just reused some old code I had lying around from my
experiments with the OAuth2 API, though I had to tweak it a little bit to be
able to actually login, using requests. Something about CSRF tokens seems to
have changed.
</p>

<p>
In the process, I found that twitter's API isn't very pleasant to use.  Or
may be it's the fact that I was using python twitter client without getting
my own client id/key, but the whole experience of dealing with the twitter
API wasn't a pleasant one at all!
</p>
</li>
<li>Amber, Daria and I also spent about an hour white-boarding some problems from
the Cracking the Code Interview book.
</li>
<li>I ended up fixing some minor issues with blaggregator and am hoping that the
long pending PR will be merged today.

  that teaches us to write a BF interpreter.
</li>
<li>I spent the Saturday revamping my Emacs config.  The main issue with my
config was having a "package" list, of all the packages that the
configuration uses, in case we are trying to duplicate it elsewhere.  I
noticed that this gets out of sync, because I install packages by hand and
never update this list.  I wrote up <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/user-lisp/setup-defuns.el">some code</a>, that keeps this list in sync
with all the packages I have installed.  I configured el-get to play well
with my config, and am pretty happy with my setup, though I still have to add
some matching/searching features with helm/ido/whatever else.

doing.  I wanted to continue writing C code, and continued to work on the
<code>bencode</code> parser in C.  I barely was able to finish adding support for lists.

not using <code>realloc</code> correctly.

a few places around here, the highlight being, the view of Manhattan's

<li>NYC's library also had an interesting exhibhition on the history of
America, just before and during WW-I.

<li>On Sunday, I tried out Mary TTS on the raspberry pi, and it is simply
unusable.
</li>
<li>I then, started writing a simple wrapper around Google's tts that is used
by Google translate.
</li>
<li>The TTS part is more or less working right now, the next step would be to
deploy it on the RaspberryPi and start using it as a radio, to see what my
needs are like. Hooking it up to <a href="https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client">Jasper client</a> seems like a good idea,
right now… though I'm not sure if it would work very well, with the pi's
audio output drowning out the voice commands.

<li>There seemed to be excitement in the space to have Jessica around.  We had
coffee with her, and I chatted with her briefly. She encouraged me to try and
send a patch to CPython, that involved debugging and fixing some C issues.
</li>
<li>I spent some time with Tom, while he tried to get <code>cinspect</code> working for him,
and it seemed like having the developer next to you, helped.  As always.  We
didn't make any fixes to the code, but it worked.
</li>
<li>I spent the afternoon, adding tests for a simple issue, to see how patches are sent.
</li>
<li>Later, I paired with Sophia for an hour to refactor the vcs code. It's
beginning to look much better than what it used to, and I like that.
</li>
<li>Jessica's talk on buffer overflows was enlightening and entertaining. It was
very similar to a talk that Max gave on one of the thursdays, but it was
exciting nevertheless.
</li>
<li>After the talk, I am inspired to try and work through the Hacking: Art of
exploitation, at some point. I'm beginning to feel like time at HackerSchool
running out!

<li>It turned out that the SPI driver exposed a faster way to write bits, writing
to all the LEDs at once, instead of one at a time, and this was sufficient to
get things working!
</li>

<li>Kyle and I started to have enough, of the glowing LEDs and decided to wrap up
the project, but, Nick had different ideas for us! We had talked about having
the music stream via airplay, but Nick got his DJing tools, and it would be
too bad to not use it for the party, but doing that meant Airplay's delay
wouldn't help the DJ. So, we connected a line-in, and thought we'd be done if
we just read the input and used that data. But, it turns out that's not so
simple because sending data over the wire, added noise to it, and in a whole
range of frequencies! I tried removing all the fourier coefficients which
were lower than a threshold, but I felt like it didn't work very well, until
Nick reduced the gain of this output on the amp to the very minimum. Finally,
Kyle and I decided that this was good enough for the party!
</li>

<li>I also hacked up a quick script to read a font file, and use the grey values
to get ascii characters to show up on the LED strip.

<li>Kyle and I went and grabbed dinner in a restaurant in west village. It was
good to sit down and talk about various things, and eat. The glowing LEDs
were totally out of my mind for that period, and the break was good!

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mel's talk in the morning was brilliant!  I wonder why it's not a part of
recommended reading for Hacker Schoolers, or referred to, in the manual.
</li>
<li>Logically, it makes sense that Mel came now, so that she didn't have to come
twice to talk to the firsts and seconds, but it would have been great to have
had this talk in the first week of Hacker School!
</li>
<li>Mel gave us a lot of new information and insights into education and learning
styles. I also like the fact that she gave us all a good vocabulary to think
about and discuss stuff related to learning. I will try to think, and apply
as much of this as I can, for the rest of my time here.
</li>
<li>She talked about <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2014/02/10/test-driven-learning-setting-learning-goals-for-yourself-software-engineering-edition/">test driven learning</a> which seemed very interesting. Instead
of just saying, "wow that would be an interesting thing to do", stop for a
moment, think about what you are trying to learn, and how you will assess if
you have learnt what you wanted to, and then dive into the project.
</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html">learning styles</a> workshop was pretty good too, though I feel like I don't
know myself well enough, and I unable to properly "bucket" myself.  Later, I
took a <a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html">quiz</a>, and ended up fairly close to the middle, in all the dimensions.
</li>
<li>Mel introduced us to the idea of <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/201816780/A-Cognitive-Apprenticeship-Primer">cognitive apprenticeship</a>, and encouraged us
to try out the different modes when pairing. I really liked the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development">Zone
of proximal development</a> and I will try to take the advice of spending most of
the rest of my time here in this zone.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I was trying to wrap libshairport and use it on the RPi to be able to listen
to songs being streamed on Airplay, and use that data to drive the LEDs.
</li>
<li>Shairport, a tool written in C seemed to work.  My attempts to wrap
<code>libshairport</code>, which is a fork of <code>shairport</code> converting it into a library,
failed miserably.
</li>
<li>The trouble was essentially getting Airplay to discover my service.  I tried
a bunch of things with <code>pybonjour</code> and <code>avahi</code>, but wasn't able to get it
right.
</li>
<li>Finally, I tried just announcing the service with <code>shairport</code>, and actually
running a python script that wraps <code>libshairport</code> to listen to the data.
But, this didn't work and iTunes complained that this Airplay device is not
compatible. Before going much further with this, I found <code>shairplay</code> which is
a tool similar to <code>shairport</code>, but came with a library, and also Python
bindings!  I happily used this to get stuff working!
