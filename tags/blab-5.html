A few days back I received a letter from a friend, via post! [I
know most of you can't believe this… but ya.. its true..] I
wouldn't have believed it too… if only he didn't tell that to me
when we met online… {He spoilt the fun for me! :-(} So before
going to dinner one day…(a couple of weeks back..).. I checked
out the Hostel Assistants room for any post…. and "it" was right
on top of the pile!! [Now that I speak of a pile don't imagine
that a lot of people here get personal letters… most of them
were business correspondence, magazines or likewise…]
Neways.. it was a great feeling to even look at it!! A white
envelope… and my name on it.. in his most familiar writing on
it…[no.. i don't get letters from him often.. we have been
classmates for quite some time.. so…] … the stamp [A leapard
cat!]… and the two postmarks.. [of Pilani &amp;amp;
Zuarinagar!! :-P]… Holding the letter in my hand.. it felt
wonderful!! [I wanted to read it right then…. but went along for
dinner…]
</p>

<p>
After dinner… and a little time in the Children's
Park… [relaxing.. wid 9,UC,Voodoo n Ringo]… I opened it! It
was absolutely thrilling… to see a couple of pages written in
ink [he still uses ink pens!! ;-)]… With full enthu.. i read the
letter.. and obviously once wasn't enough to satiate my hunger.. i
went through it over and over and over… [i wanted to scribble
down a reply ASAP… but we had waves and quark coming up.. so i
waited for them to get over (I could've written another one
right??)…to get more matter into my letter..]
</p>

<p>
Why is such a simple joy of getting a letter from a friend [there
is email.. but… for me its nowhere close to snail mail…]
become so rare these days?? [Something that was such a regular
feature of the recent past.. is almost extinct now!!] Telephone
and the Internet…. they are the culprits… (are they??…..) In
today's global village… is post a bit too slow for comfort? Will
survival of the fittest ensure the extiction of this wonderful
species in the world of communication…??
</p>

<p>
Is a letter just a matter of communication…?… Isn't there
anything more to it… [Obviously there is… otherwise I wouldn't
be writing a blog-post on it…I would never think of writing a
post on an e-mail I get!! (unless it is superhuman.. or
something..)!!] Aren't we losing out on something wonderful??

Such wonderful things they are… bringing to us.. such a joy
[even if its about something not so pleasant…]… the joy of
discovering things.. of realising a truth… that was hidden
somewhere within… brought out with an elegant swoooosh!!…
</p>

<p>
We, 9, Voodoo, Ravi, UC n me] were just walking on the
street… enjoying the evening… after a nice day @ Quark [Day
2]… We were having a casual discussion… not discussing
anything in particular… but somehow the discussion led to a
project uc,ravi n me [ and probably the others are too..(they
didn't talk abt it…)] are interested in… [i don't wanna give
any more info abt the project.. bcos it may seem over-ambitious to
a few.. not that it hasn't been done already…. but…]
neways….
</p>

<p>
so… while we were talkin abt it… uc said, he didn't have any
clue about that thing worked… and we all were wondering
too… thinking about some possible solutions/methods….[I was
actually trying to recollect something i came across… some time
back…] but then suddenly 9 jumped in, to say…
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Don't think about how 'that' works… Just think about how 'YOU'
would make it work!!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh my God!! now that's what's a REVELATION… I was just
dumb-struck… that one small statement of his… drowned me in
its depths… I feel I still haven't come out of it… A big big
revelation at the most unexpected of times, at the most unexpected
of places…. [though 9 wouldn't agree with this… being his
usual modest self…]
</p>

<p>
Its been proved time and again… "they" can occur
anywhere… anytime and to anyone… while you are on the
street.. in your room.. at work… or even in the loo… [Most ppl
have a lot of them here!!].. we just need to keep our eyes n ears
open… and most importantly our Mind……  ps: it seems…me not
delving out the details about our ambitious project.. makes this
post a little vague, uninteresting n difficult to relate to… but
still…  In the fields of observation chance favors only the
prepared mind –Louis Pasteur

A DJ nite's going on here.. for WAVES…. I just went there for a
while….  The arrangements were pretty good… with Huge huge
huge spks.. [I can still hear the Music quite loud.. sitting here
in my room.. which is quite a distance form the Venue…] There's
real Heart throbbing music [Literally… With speakers of over
15000W your heart really throbs… dub.. dub.. dub…] being
played there…
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering if we really needed such extravagant
stuff… I know that such events bring ppl together… but do we
need to spend so much money just to have a have a good dance with
friends?? When a large number of people aren't able to get their
basic neccessities like a Square Meal, Clean drinking water,
proper clothing and shelter… here we are enjoying a good dance
with friends… with elaborately made extravagant
arrangements… [of course the money isn't ours… but…] [ I
know a lot of guys wud've a lot to say against me…. but.. its
ok..]

<p>
There can't be perfect equality in this world… of which duality
is an integral part…. every elementary particle has a dual
nature… so its but obvious that every thing in this world has a
dual to it… so its not possible to have a perfect world with
everybody equally placed.. if there is a rich.. then there will be
a poor… if there is joy.. then there will be despair… if there
is light.. then there will be darkness…
</p>

<p>
But can't we do anything… can't we spread the light to every
place that we possibly could?? Can't we get together to minimize
the difference? Join the race against nature… do your bit…
</p>

<p>
This, probably, is a good place to start off…

Imagine a kid reading Shakespeare's Othello or As You Like
it…[or may be some other classic poem…] with great difficulty
he somehow manages to read the whole thing… [with all the
archaic language etc..] he understands the basic plot and the
story and likes it… but will he be able to appreciate the work?
Will he be able to see the beauty of it?? Isn't a good knowledge
of Language a bare essential for one to enjoy a Literary work??
</p>

<p>
Now consider a layman… listening to Classical [say Carnatic]
Music… if he's got no knowledge of the Basic structure and
organisation of Music in general or a Raga in particular.. then he
may enjoy the musical work… listen to it happily…. but will he
get the taste of its nectar from the fine intricacies in it??
Isn't a basic sense of Music… a knowledge of the language of
Music necessary to understand the fine points of a Musical piece??
</p>

<p>
Isn't the case similar with Science [Feynman says nature..]??
Without a proper knowledge base in Mathematics.. how would I
possibly understand and appreciate Physics/Science (in general..)
and Relativity in particular?? [I got this feeling, after class
today, for the zillionth time…] How can I possibly enjoy a
course in Relativity without a proper Math background???
</p>

<p>
I need to learn a lot of Mathematics.. its high time I do it… :(
</p>

<p>
To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across
a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature
… If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is
necessary to understand the language that she speaks in.

We are less than a week away from our supposedly dreaded
'test-1'… n i have no clue even about what the syllabus is, in
each course… There's 'Theory of Relativity', of which i'm able
to make no head or tail.. then there's 'Electrical Sciences',
which totally "transformed" my plans for this
sem… then…SPM.. muP.. POM… MT.. C&amp;amp;S………
</p>

<p>
There are loads and loads of other stuff too…
</p>

<p>
Relativity… Emacs…. C++… Python… Table Tennis… learning
a bit of Music… picking up practical electronic
skills… reading a few books…(quite a few actually..).. and so
on…. [not to forget.. attending classes… doing a bit of course
related work…]. The list seems only to be growing everyday…
</p>

<p>
There's nothing that I've crossed out yet.. there's not one thing
that's done to perfection…[with a third of the sem already
through!!] {I already get the feeling.. its "Another sem down the
drain"}
</p>

<p>
But didn't I begin this sem with plans to "rock" it?? Wasn't I
supposed to attend all the classes that I possible can?? What's it
that I've been doing for the past 5-6 weeks?
</p>

<p>
I don't know!! I really can't pinpoint what's been achieved in the
past one month or so… [other than of course quite a considerable
amount of sleep…….]
</p>

<p>
Why are things so horribly out of place?? What's to be done.. to
get on track asap.. I wonder… What should my priorities be? Why
am I being overwhelmed by the things I got to do?
</p>

<p>
I realise this time of my life is as precious as any
other… (probably more…) and i need to make the most of
it…. but what is that "most"?? [It's definitely not sleep!]

definitely seems possible<br>

<br>
but it must come<br>
before I get back home<br>
needn't create an uproar<br>

[Don't mistake this for a poem… for it is not!! Its just some

this sem… there's nothing other than this.. which is
tangible… something concrete.. something "see"able]

Hi! I'm a bit late…(courtesy:lightning quick network speeds
@coll…{I started this post a couple of weeks back, at
home… and its been rotting all this while, in my drafts!} ) [Its
already time when the resolutions taken just a couple of weeks
back fade away into oblivion… ] but anyways.. Wish You a Very
Happy gNew Year!! oops.. Happy New Year!
</p>

<p>
Actually this year started of for me not as the usual Happy New
Year.. but as Happy gNew Year! I have been gifted a new PC by my
mom n dad for the new year… and that too an AMD system, (Believe
it or Not..) preloaded with Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4]!
{Its like a fairy tale for me…} Its an AMD Athlon 3200+ with
(512+256)MB RAM and 80GBHDD…. and an awesome 17" TFT Monitor!!
</p>

<p>
I am happy that my resolutions to have a go at the comp… [ and
use it to the best of my abilities to learn about s/w and
h/w…. to try n imbibe in myself the spirit of true hacking…]
haven't yet gone down the drain! { I've already ripped open the
HCL company seal on my box… and opened it up a couple of times
to fiddle with my HDD and RAM… }
</p>

<p>
A couple of days after I got the comp… I tried installing
Debian… and being a NooB doesn't help..(does it?).. I messed up
the X-Server…  After some desperate attempts to get the thing
working.. I gave up……. [I had some ebooks etc. downloaded on
my comp at home, which I wished to dump on my comp]. So I
persisted… I tried FC 6 [Fedora Core] …. everything was fine
until the final step… FC refused to show me the Login screen!!
Finally at 3 am I gave up…. I planned to get the most valuable
stuff onto a CD and set things right, back in the comforts of my
room and the company of Voodoo, but that was not to be….
</p>

<p>
At 10am, (I just woke up then), I find that the comp at home
refuses to turn ON!! I thought it was some petty problem like a
loose contact somewhere, which could be set right easily.. but
after an hour of struggle.. I realise that the problem is
serious.. {The SMPS had blown off} [looks like a Hindi
Movie,doesn't it??]
</p>

<p>
Then began the real fun!! I somehow managed to connect the old
hard disk to the new Mother Board…[my new cabinet is quite
small… I now realize that I placed the HDD in quite a precarious
position…].. but there was no OS on either HDD… [the "Windows"
on the old one…. din't open… they felt awkward in their new
environs… ;-) ] I would have returned back to coll without any
of my stuff.. but for Knoppix (live) … it saved the day for me!!
Finally I managed to dump my stuff onto the new HDD… [All 's
well that ends well!! :-)] Now I've got both the Linux distro's
[Debian and FC-6] along with all the stuff I collected at home! [
Thanks to V00d00!! ] along with a little confidence that I am not
too bad at handling H/W!
</p>

<p>
When I look back at this whole episode… It feels as if nature
had conspired…. to keep this one resolution of mine ALIVE…. to
ignite in me the fire of "the spirit of true hacking"… [ I hope
that I play my part well.. (nature played its brilliantly…) and
pick up a zillionth part of the commitment ( and dedication to
hacking) of the Hackers from the Hacker Land!! ]
</p>

<p>
Here's a pic of one of the very few cool things I could get my
comp to do….. [ I accessed the Remote Desktop Server on my own
system…..]

I was at the B.M Birla Science Musuem yesterday… it was calm
with no one in there.. the only people i could see were the
sweepers and cleaners.. the place was dull and lifeless… I dint
like it.. but slowly.. as the afternoon progressed.. people
started coming in and by 5 in the evening.. there were quite a few
in. The museum seemed to have sprung to life suddenly… there was
a lot of action all around with people enjoying in ( and trying to
understand) the wonderful world of science….
</p>

<p>
A lot of kids had come along with their parents… to dive into
the world of science… they were enjoying it… the parents also
turned into kids and were having great fun… it was a great
sight… the parents tried their best to demistify the
happenings… those with a science background did it from thier
knowledge.. the others patiently went through the explanations…
</p>

<p>
The kids were thoroughly enjoying it… I don't know if they would
later on in life remember what they learnt now… but definitely a
love for science and physics will be ignited in their hearts, it
will fill their consciousness… the spirit of curiosity will have
multiplied manifold… even the elders..connected with the child
somewhere deep within themselves… they too enjoyed the wonders
of the world of science…[and ofcourse the company and thrill in
the eyes of their kids..] I too enjoyed the experience… the
experiments and the thrill of the others brought a smile to my
face too…. but it set me thinking…
</p>

<p>
If science can inspire so much awe.. what's happening at our
engineering colleges? When people have the chance to learn a whole
lot of science and put it to practical use… why isn't it that
they are excited about it? Why is it that people just endup
mugging a few formulae just before exams and get over with it?
Where's the problem? Where is that curiosity, all of us had as a
child, lost?
</p>

<p>
I can recollect, in the last sem while doing experiments in the MT
lab there wasn't even a tenth of the awe or joy… that i could
see and feel at the museum… why?? Is it that the child within
us.. [the future engineers] dead? { If that's true.. then the
country is in deep trouble..} But I don't think that's true… I
enjoyed my visit to the museum totally…and I am sure every other
'to be engineer' would have too.. then where's the trouble?
</p>

<p>
I don't know exactly… but I wonder if its because everything is
equated to marks and grades… all that matters to an engineering
student [and the world around him/her..] is his/her CG or
%age… Is this what the country needs? Were the 'temples of
Learning'- the IIT's and a whole lot of other technical
institutions set-up for this very pupose? Of what use are those
engineers to the country, who aren't in awe of science and
engineering, whose spirit of curiosity has been overpowered and
suppressed by the present education system?
</p>

<p>
Isn't it time we have a closer look at our education system… why
are we still sticking to the 'British sytem' introduced during a
colonial rule.. to break the back bone of our nation… to supress
our ability to think rationally.. to produce third rate clerks to
work for them at lower wages? Why is the emphasis on marks and
grades growing exponentially? Shouldn't we start working to cut
this growth at its root? Is this sytem good enough to produce
"real" engineers, doctors, lawyers, journos, CA's, architects,
designers, writers, artists etc etc..

Where have all the gurukuls of the ancient past and the
Santiniketans of the recent past gone? Isn't the country in
desparate need of more of these 'temples of learning'??

I am back Home!! After one more ordinary semester, (academically,
otherwise quite a dramatic one actually) finally i'm back home! On
my way back home……
</p>

<p>
It was 3:30 am. After about half an hour's struggle to put myself
to sleep, I gave up. I don't know if it was the chill of the
night, the stink of the urinals or the shared berth that I slept
on, I couldn't sleep. I decided to get up and have a stroll
around. After some random walks, I sat down at the TTE's seat and
waited and waited and waited….
</p>

<p>
My last journey home, at the end of second sem was also quite
similar. I spent a lot of time at the TTE's seat…unable to
sleep… waiting, waiting and waiting.. but it was quite
different…. I was in the elite company of Hari (Hari Charan
a.k.a Prongs… his nick in CS)
</p>

<p>
That journey is still very fresh in my memory… I spent most of
it with him; The morning was busy and lively with DumbC's n stuff
like that. In the afternoon while the others were enjoying a good
nap, we tried studying some C programming. [ he just loved
programming and was excited about doing a lotta cool stuff during
the summer] But the afternoon heat got the better of me and
eventually i fell asleep…{I think, I induced a bit of sleep to
him too ;-) }
</p>

<p>
That night is a most unforgettable one… after all our guys went
to sleep, both of us decided to spend some time listening to songs
and try to put ourselves to sleep. [ The songs of RDB aren't
lullabies by any measure! and the train was running too fast: we
couldn't hear clearly with just one earphone each, even if we were
on the top berth]
</p>

<p>
So, we ended up discussing matters of common interest… we
chatted on topics ranging from Movies to Religion and Culture to
Dan Brown [he told me the whole story of Deception point in his
trademark style!] to Games and Programming. I spoke my heart
out… {and so did he; as he always did} [haven't had any other
discussion which comes close to it] After a couple of hours, we
decided to get down and move around, to enjoy the cool breeze, to
look at the villages and the fields going past… We shared the
seat of the TTE for about an hour [that was the only window where
we could sit : all the others had ppl sleeping beside them]
… looking out of the window… enjoying the breeze.. [and each
other's company : I thoroughly enjoyed his.. hope it was the same
with him too] and waiting, waiting and waiting…
</p>

<p>
We had already spent three nights waiting for him, but still
didn't lose hope. We hoped he would some how return or would be
found safe somewhere under the sun. But that was not to be. He
never returned… and all that was ever found was his body :
lifeless… The rough seas had him their victim… "There's no
more Hari Charan, ra!". Those were the words of nine.
</p>

<p>
Yes he is no more.Yet he is always here, immortal within our
hearts… his memories we cherish with pride… proud to have
known him and known by him… with awe and reverence we think of
him… we just love him! But I'll always miss that call of his,
"Chogni!"

Just finished the 'Test-2'. Here's the first
post that can genuinely be called "mine"…
</p>

<p>
With my last minute 'C2S' plans [Co-operate to Survive… does it
ring any bells??] failing to work, the tests did their job,cleaned
me up [both literally and metaphorically]. Though I didn't learn
much while preparing for the tests, the syllabus gave me a brain
wave (surprised to find that my Brain is still ticking…. after
more than one year of Engg.) : Build my first Computer game!!
[Don't expect too much from it… I'm a novice at programming and
my game doesn't even have a GUI as of now!]
</p>

<p>
I had been doing a l'l bit of C programming off late but, I never
learnt 'file management' until the "Test-2" forced me to, and
Viola! I embarked on a self assigned, "Project - Hangman".
</p>

<p>
Here's a peek at the game… [after a lot of
testing and debugging (the use of technical terms is just a matter
of "phantee")]
</p>

<p>
"Phantee"- a typical hyderabadi term; has no literal english
translation; refers to "concealing ignorance in style" ??
</p>

<p>
The basics were quite simple and were done in
two hours… but then began the real test! The program needed a
lot of improvements to make it "Playable" but, the tests were less
than a week away.
</p>

<p>
I managed to find enough time even during the
tests (it doesn't really matter whether you spend a week, a day or
just an hour mugging - you are bound to be cleaned up!), and
finished most of the stuff within a week.
</p>

<p>
There were quite a few road blocks which I had to get
around. Amongst other things, obtaining a 'decent' database of
words was one. Initially, I wrote another program for building up
a dbase of your own. This wasn't good enough…. so, with some
ideas from Arunodai, I successfully integrated a dbase of 14000
words [picked it from another version of hangman] with my own
version. After one whole week of debugging and improving {with an
annoying disturbance called 'Test-2'}, now my game is quite
'playable' (i.e it can be played by people other than me).
</p>

<p>
So you might say, "what's the big-deal about writing a simple
program of about hundred lines, that can randomly display words
and check if you guess it right within seven turns?". This l'll
project of mine may seem like a Pro'jest' to many! [writing a
complex code, messing it up, debugging it for one whole week, etc
just for the sake of creating a simple game, that can be played if
you have a friend,a pen and a paper. Doing so much&lt;span
class="text"&gt; for a game, that already has 'n' version,
seems very foolish and a collosal waste
of time and effort. Doesn't it??] Obviously, that's not a great
achievement, its not something thats worth a mention in the
Guiness Book of World Records or something. But it taught me a lot
of stuff, stuff that you can't learn from books,stuff that you
can't learn by mugging [I wonder if you can learn anything under
the sun by "Mugging"], stuff that you can only learn by
experience.I learnt a lot more of Computer Programming through
this project, than I learnt through two, '3-point' courses!! {Of
course, I wouldn't have even dreamt of doing such a thing, if not
for these two courses, that introduced me to programming and
taught me the essentials}. Can't such projects make the other
courses a joy too?
</p>

<p>
This brings me to our recent TRW [Technical Report Writing]
project. You might wonder what kind of projects could be given in
this kind of a course. We were asked to write a report on 'Waste
Management' in our college, and to include some suggestions on the
ways to improve it. Though this was an interesting job, with scope
for some field activity and other such stuff, we [a group of six
members] successfully turned the 'project' into a Pro'jest'!!
[that's my personal view; the others in the group may
disagree].But still, we learnt a lot on Report writing. A lot more
than what we learnt by reading pages and pages of instructions, on
the techniques of writing good reports,by the so called experts.
</p>

<p>
Both the projects helped me understand stuff better and to put
them to use. Why can't all courses have little projects, along
with the routine stuff? Will it not improve my understanding of
the subject matter? Will I not learn a great deal of things more
than I do by mugging things up, just a week before the tests? Will
it not be an experience, a lesson, of its own??
</p>

<p>
I wonder if my "Engineering", will ever be a joy for me?
</p>

<p>
I am looking forward to more Projects… to make engineering a joy
for me!! [it doesn't matter even if they're self-assigned ;-) ]
