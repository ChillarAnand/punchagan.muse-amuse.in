PS stands for Practice School…
</p>

<p>
I would've titled this post, "NPL… here I come!!" but for all
this…
</p>

<p>
It all began with an unannounced letter from the PS
division… giving us just 5 days time to fill up our "PS-1"
forms… with Waves round the corner.. this was too short a
notice.. and the panic button was pressed.. and pressed real
hard!! {lots of heated discussion.. frantic google
searches.. repeated calls to/from home.. etc were kicked off…}
</p>

<p>
Then, the filling up of on-line forms… [oh you thought.. online
forms were a cakewalk?? even i thought so.. until this!!] We had
to fill a priority list of 214 items.. flat… That was not the
big problem… We had a not so well developed form handler…[i'm
probably being unfair to the developers…because the server also
caused quite a few problems… but that's the least i can say…]
I know of people.. who learnt their options by-heart… thanks to
the wonderful system and the server, that made them fill the whole
list 4 to 5 times..
</p>

<p>
Then there was this headache of filling up everything in
ink… [one of the rare ocassions.. other than reports for MT n
Mu-P… when i wrote so much.. and felt it all useless…]
</p>

<p>
Then, a meeting organised by seniors to "help" us choose
PS[Practice School] stations… noble intentions.. but i ended up
being more confused!! [After telling all the good stuff.. they
came down to the point that staying close to home.. is the best
thing to do.. this put me in soup!]
</p>

<p>
All this is nothing when compared to the "declaration of results"
(it wasn't any exam.. to call the allotment.. results.. but the
use of these words is intentional…)  First, there was an April
fool attempt by one of the students… it was quite cleverly
planned but the little error of sending everyone the same
password.. ended the whole thing tamely.. but it dindn't go for
nothing.. it was successful in rebuilding the stage… people
began discussing the topic..
</p>

<p>
After a wait of 4 days… the D-day finally arrived… and people
went crazy!! As if the excitement wasn't enough.. the PSD added
its bit.. the results weren't sent to everyone at once.. they sent
it one by one, discipline-wise… (god only knows how they managed
the feat[around 1400 students!!], manually) People were eagerly
waiting for the results… a world cup final would have been no
match… F5 keys on all the keyboards took a beating… People
shouting wildly!! (both in delight and rage..).. There was quite a
lot of Drama…
</p>

<p>
Now after the reality has sunk in… its a bit cooler… but still
quite humid.. every talk inevitably is leading just to this… a
lot of analysis, discussions and post-mortem going on…. happy
about their partners/collegues… people getting angry with
others(both for discussing and not discussing about
it..)… unhappy with partners… phew! a lot of action all around
the place… [It's as if a sleeping Giant has just been woken
up…]
</p>

<p>
After all this hype and ballyhoo.. i just hope the PS stands up to
something… I mean.. I hope I stand up to it…. and do
something.. some small bit of work.. that'll keep me hooked for a
couple of months.. something that'll be worth thinking of later on
in life… something that'll be worth posting abt…:-P
ok!…. "NPL… Here I come…!!"

There's a post already with 'exactly' this name…. by 9… here…
But this post doesn't have much to do with his post… [or may be it does??]
</p>

<p>
Here's a Quote on Mahatma Gandhi…
/Generations to come, it may be, will scarcely believe that such a
one, as this, ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. –
Albert Einstein/
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering…. what would happen if the name Albert
Einstein was replaced by punchagan… and it turned out
that.. there's a huge huge list of candidates for replacing
Mahatma Gandhi… [This is with due respect to the Mahatma and
Einstein.. I don't, in any sense, intend to say that the Mahatma
was not a Mahatma…]
</p>

<p>
All I want to say is… I am seeing a whole lot of new things, in
people around me, that inspire awe and respect in me… that every
person is unique… every person is special.. every person can
teach you something…. there's something to learn from
everyperson… that makes me believe God,truly, created man in his
own image…
</p>

<p>
I am grateful to all the people around me (and those not around
any more..)… who have shown, are showing, and will be showing me
things bright and beautiful… wise and wonderful… which
otherwise I would have failed to see..
</p>

<p>
I am grateful… for getting me back on track.. when i go
directionless,.. for setting me examples to emulate,… for being
with me whenever i needed and will need you…

that's too big a job for this little being to achieve… ]

Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
and not giving it.

<p>
To All Jaani's of the World… Thanks a Lot… (I know that's too
small a word… but that's all I can give right now…)

    <p>
A few days back I received a letter from a friend, via post! [I
know most of you can't believe this… but ya.. its true..] I
wouldn't have believed it too… if only he didn't tell that to me
when we met online… {He spoilt the fun for me! :-(} So before
going to dinner one day…(a couple of weeks back..).. I checked
out the Hostel Assistants room for any post…. and "it" was right
on top of the pile!! [Now that I speak of a pile don't imagine
that a lot of people here get personal letters… most of them
were business correspondence, magazines or likewise…]
Neways.. it was a great feeling to even look at it!! A white
envelope… and my name on it.. in his most familiar writing on
it…[no.. i don't get letters from him often.. we have been
classmates for quite some time.. so…] … the stamp [A leapard
cat!]… and the two postmarks.. [of Pilani &amp;amp;
Zuarinagar!! :-P]… Holding the letter in my hand.. it felt
wonderful!! [I wanted to read it right then…. but went along for
dinner…]
</p>

<p>
After dinner… and a little time in the Children's
Park… [relaxing.. wid 9,UC,Voodoo n Ringo]… I opened it! It
was absolutely thrilling… to see a couple of pages written in
ink [he still uses ink pens!! ;-)]… With full enthu.. i read the
letter.. and obviously once wasn't enough to satiate my hunger.. i
went through it over and over and over… [i wanted to scribble
down a reply ASAP… but we had waves and quark coming up.. so i
waited for them to get over (I could've written another one
right??)…to get more matter into my letter..]
</p>

<p>
Why is such a simple joy of getting a letter from a friend [there
is email.. but… for me its nowhere close to snail mail…]
become so rare these days?? [Something that was such a regular
feature of the recent past.. is almost extinct now!!] Telephone
and the Internet…. they are the culprits… (are they??…..) In
today's global village… is post a bit too slow for comfort? Will
survival of the fittest ensure the extiction of this wonderful
species in the world of communication…??
</p>

<p>
Is a letter just a matter of communication…?… Isn't there
anything more to it… [Obviously there is… otherwise I wouldn't
be writing a blog-post on it…I would never think of writing a
post on an e-mail I get!! (unless it is superhuman.. or
something..)!!] Aren't we losing out on something wonderful??

Such wonderful things they are… bringing to us.. such a joy
[even if its about something not so pleasant…]… the joy of
discovering things.. of realising a truth… that was hidden
somewhere within… brought out with an elegant swoooosh!!…
</p>

<p>
We, 9, Voodoo, Ravi, UC n me] were just walking on the
street… enjoying the evening… after a nice day @ Quark [Day
2]… We were having a casual discussion… not discussing
anything in particular… but somehow the discussion led to a
project uc,ravi n me [ and probably the others are too..(they
didn't talk abt it…)] are interested in… [i don't wanna give
any more info abt the project.. bcos it may seem over-ambitious to
a few.. not that it hasn't been done already…. but…]
neways….
</p>

<p>
so… while we were talkin abt it… uc said, he didn't have any
clue about that thing worked… and we all were wondering
too… thinking about some possible solutions/methods….[I was
actually trying to recollect something i came across… some time
back…] but then suddenly 9 jumped in, to say…
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Don't think about how 'that' works… Just think about how 'YOU'
would make it work!!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh my God!! now that's what's a REVELATION… I was just
dumb-struck… that one small statement of his… drowned me in
its depths… I feel I still haven't come out of it… A big big
revelation at the most unexpected of times, at the most unexpected
of places…. [though 9 wouldn't agree with this… being his
usual modest self…]
</p>

<p>
Its been proved time and again… "they" can occur
anywhere… anytime and to anyone… while you are on the
street.. in your room.. at work… or even in the loo… [Most ppl
have a lot of them here!!].. we just need to keep our eyes n ears
open… and most importantly our Mind……  ps: it seems…me not
delving out the details about our ambitious project.. makes this
post a little vague, uninteresting n difficult to relate to… but
still…  In the fields of observation chance favors only the

A DJ nite's going on here.. for WAVES…. I just went there for a
while….  The arrangements were pretty good… with Huge huge
huge spks.. [I can still hear the Music quite loud.. sitting here
in my room.. which is quite a distance form the Venue…] There's
real Heart throbbing music [Literally… With speakers of over
15000W your heart really throbs… dub.. dub.. dub…] being
played there…

<p>
I was just wondering if we really needed such extravagant
stuff… I know that such events bring ppl together… but do we
need to spend so much money just to have a have a good dance with
friends?? When a large number of people aren't able to get their
basic neccessities like a Square Meal, Clean drinking water,
proper clothing and shelter… here we are enjoying a good dance
with friends… with elaborately made extravagant
arrangements… [of course the money isn't ours… but…] [ I
know a lot of guys wud've a lot to say against me…. but.. its
ok..]
</p>

<p>
There can't be perfect equality in this world… of which duality
is an integral part…. every elementary particle has a dual
nature… so its but obvious that every thing in this world has a
dual to it… so its not possible to have a perfect world with
everybody equally placed.. if there is a rich.. then there will be
a poor… if there is joy.. then there will be despair… if there
is light.. then there will be darkness…
</p>

<p>
But can't we do anything… can't we spread the light to every
place that we possibly could?? Can't we get together to minimize
the difference? Join the race against nature… do your bit…
</p>

<p>
This, probably, is a good place to start off…

Imagine a kid reading Shakespeare's Othello or As You Like
it…[or may be some other classic poem…] with great difficulty
he somehow manages to read the whole thing… [with all the
archaic language etc..] he understands the basic plot and the
story and likes it… but will he be able to appreciate the work?
Will he be able to see the beauty of it?? Isn't a good knowledge
of Language a bare essential for one to enjoy a Literary work??
</p>

<p>
Now consider a layman… listening to Classical [say Carnatic]
Music… if he's got no knowledge of the Basic structure and
organisation of Music in general or a Raga in particular.. then he
may enjoy the musical work… listen to it happily…. but will he
get the taste of its nectar from the fine intricacies in it??
Isn't a basic sense of Music… a knowledge of the language of
Music necessary to understand the fine points of a Musical piece??
</p>

<p>
Isn't the case similar with Science [Feynman says nature..]??
Without a proper knowledge base in Mathematics.. how would I
possibly understand and appreciate Physics/Science (in general..)
and Relativity in particular?? [I got this feeling, after class
today, for the zillionth time…] How can I possibly enjoy a
course in Relativity without a proper Math background???
</p>

<p>
I need to learn a lot of Mathematics.. its high time I do it… :(
</p>

<p>
To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across
a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature
… If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is
necessary to understand the language that she speaks in.

    <p>
We are less than a week away from our supposedly dreaded
'test-1'… n i have no clue even about what the syllabus is, in
each course… There's 'Theory of Relativity', of which i'm able
to make no head or tail.. then there's 'Electrical Sciences',
which totally "transformed" my plans for this
sem… then…SPM.. muP.. POM… MT.. C&amp;amp;S………
</p>

<p>
There are loads and loads of other stuff too…
</p>

<p>
Relativity… Emacs…. C++… Python… Table Tennis… learning
a bit of Music… picking up practical electronic
skills… reading a few books…(quite a few actually..).. and so
on…. [not to forget.. attending classes… doing a bit of course
related work…]. The list seems only to be growing everyday…
</p>

<p>
There's nothing that I've crossed out yet.. there's not one thing
that's done to perfection…[with a third of the sem already
through!!] {I already get the feeling.. its "Another sem down the
drain"}
</p>

<p>
But didn't I begin this sem with plans to "rock" it?? Wasn't I
supposed to attend all the classes that I possible can?? What's it
that I've been doing for the past 5-6 weeks?
</p>

<p>
I don't know!! I really can't pinpoint what's been achieved in the
past one month or so… [other than of course quite a considerable
amount of sleep…….]
</p>

<p>
Why are things so horribly out of place?? What's to be done.. to
get on track asap.. I wonder… What should my priorities be? Why
am I being overwhelmed by the things I got to do?
</p>

<p>
I realise this time of my life is as precious as any
other… (probably more…) and i need to make the most of
it…. but what is that "most"?? [It's definitely not sleep!]

if there is the quantum of struggle…<br><br>
but it must come<br>
before I get back home<br>
needn't create an uproar<br>
but before the end of semsester four<br></p>

<p>
[Don't mistake this for a poem… for it is not!! Its just some
scribbling of mine.. which will keep me alive if at the end of
this sem… there's nothing other than this.. which is
tangible… something concrete.. something "see"able]

(512+256)MB RAM and 80GBHDD…. and an awesome 17" TFT Monitor!!
</p>

<p>
I am happy that my resolutions to have a go at the comp… [ and
use it to the best of my abilities to learn about s/w and
h/w…. to try n imbibe in myself the spirit of true hacking…]
haven't yet gone down the drain! { I've already ripped open the
HCL company seal on my box… and opened it up a couple of times
to fiddle with my HDD and RAM… }
</p>

<p>
A couple of days after I got the comp… I tried installing
Debian… and being a NooB doesn't help..(does it?).. I messed up
the X-Server…  After some desperate attempts to get the thing
working.. I gave up……. [I had some ebooks etc. downloaded on
my comp at home, which I wished to dump on my comp]. So I
persisted… I tried FC 6 [Fedora Core] …. everything was fine
until the final step… FC refused to show me the Login screen!!
Finally at 3 am I gave up…. I planned to get the most valuable
stuff onto a CD and set things right, back in the comforts of my
room and the company of Voodoo, but that was not to be….
</p>

<p>
At 10am, (I just woke up then), I find that the comp at home
refuses to turn ON!! I thought it was some petty problem like a
loose contact somewhere, which could be set right easily.. but
after an hour of struggle.. I realise that the problem is
serious.. {The SMPS had blown off} [looks like a Hindi
Movie,doesn't it??]
</p>

<p>
Then began the real fun!! I somehow managed to connect the old
hard disk to the new Mother Board…[my new cabinet is quite
small… I now realize that I placed the HDD in quite a precarious
position…].. but there was no OS on either HDD… [the "Windows"
on the old one…. din't open… they felt awkward in their new
environs… ;-) ] I would have returned back to coll without any
of my stuff.. but for Knoppix (live) … it saved the day for me!!
Finally I managed to dump my stuff onto the new HDD… [All 's
well that ends well!! :-)] Now I've got both the Linux distro's
[Debian and FC-6] along with all the stuff I collected at home! [
Thanks to V00d00!! ] along with a little confidence that I am not
too bad at handling H/W!
</p>

<p>
When I look back at this whole episode… It feels as if nature
had conspired…. to keep this one resolution of mine ALIVE…. to
ignite in me the fire of "the spirit of true hacking"… [ I hope
that I play my part well.. (nature played its brilliantly…) and
pick up a zillionth part of the commitment ( and dedication to
hacking) of the Hackers from the Hacker Land!! ]
</p>

<p>
Here's a pic of one of the very few cool things I could get my
comp to do….. [ I accessed the Remote Desktop Server on my own
system…..]

I was at the B.M Birla Science Musuem yesterday… it was calm
with no one in there.. the only people i could see were the
sweepers and cleaners.. the place was dull and lifeless… I dint
like it.. but slowly.. as the afternoon progressed.. people
started coming in and by 5 in the evening.. there were quite a few
in. The museum seemed to have sprung to life suddenly… there was
a lot of action all around with people enjoying in ( and trying to
understand) the wonderful world of science….
</p>

<p>
A lot of kids had come along with their parents… to dive into
the world of science… they were enjoying it… the parents also
turned into kids and were having great fun… it was a great
sight… the parents tried their best to demistify the
happenings… those with a science background did it from thier
knowledge.. the others patiently went through the explanations…
</p>

<p>
The kids were thoroughly enjoying it… I don't know if they would
later on in life remember what they learnt now… but definitely a
love for science and physics will be ignited in their hearts, it
will fill their consciousness… the spirit of curiosity will have
multiplied manifold… even the elders..connected with the child
somewhere deep within themselves… they too enjoyed the wonders
of the world of science…[and ofcourse the company and thrill in
the eyes of their kids..] I too enjoyed the experience… the
experiments and the thrill of the others brought a smile to my
face too…. but it set me thinking…
</p>

<p>
If science can inspire so much awe.. what's happening at our
engineering colleges? When people have the chance to learn a whole
lot of science and put it to practical use… why isn't it that
they are excited about it? Why is it that people just endup
mugging a few formulae just before exams and get over with it?
Where's the problem? Where is that curiosity, all of us had as a
child, lost?
</p>

<p>
I can recollect, in the last sem while doing experiments in the MT
lab there wasn't even a tenth of the awe or joy… that i could
see and feel at the museum… why?? Is it that the child within
us.. [the future engineers] dead? { If that's true.. then the
country is in deep trouble..} But I don't think that's true… I
enjoyed my visit to the museum totally…and I am sure every other
'to be engineer' would have too.. then where's the trouble?
</p>

<p>
I don't know exactly… but I wonder if its because everything is
equated to marks and grades… all that matters to an engineering
student [and the world around him/her..] is his/her CG or
%age… Is this what the country needs? Were the 'temples of
Learning'- the IIT's and a whole lot of other technical
institutions set-up for this very pupose? Of what use are those
engineers to the country, who aren't in awe of science and
engineering, whose spirit of curiosity has been overpowered and
suppressed by the present education system?
</p>

<p>
Isn't it time we have a closer look at our education system… why
are we still sticking to the 'British sytem' introduced during a
colonial rule.. to break the back bone of our nation… to supress
our ability to think rationally.. to produce third rate clerks to
work for them at lower wages? Why is the emphasis on marks and
grades growing exponentially? Shouldn't we start working to cut
this growth at its root? Is this sytem good enough to produce
"real" engineers, doctors, lawyers, journos, CA's, architects,
designers, writers, artists etc etc..
</p>

<p>
Where have all the gurukuls of the ancient past and the
Santiniketans of the recent past gone? Isn't the country in
desparate need of more of these 'temples of learning'??
