the time, together spent,&lt;br&gt;
the memories cherished,&lt;br&gt;
all the love, concern and care&lt;br&gt;
may they stay with us, for life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
as high and far as you like&lt;br&gt;
may you fly, like you own the sky&lt;br&gt;
while I fumble, with my flying guide&lt;br&gt;
I see the world, through your eyes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
may you run, with all your might&lt;br&gt;
as if, fighting for life, you are.&lt;br&gt;
struggling to walk, I stumble and fall,&lt;br&gt;
but get up each time, inspired to run.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
may you, in all that we shared&lt;br&gt;
find strength to go on, if en-route&lt;br&gt;
our paths diverged; you may have to wait,&lt;br&gt;
but you shall see me, on the other side!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to Chaitu, I re-read Love Unvoiced a few times and
realized, I was trying to say too much. Here's another poem,
with one part of what I wanted to say. I will not be writing
newer poems, to say the other stuff. Perform your own Fourier
analysis.

&lt;br&gt;
Hard, I tried, to stay mum,&lt;br&gt;
and keep it all within.&lt;br&gt;
But, not much longer can I stand,&lt;br&gt;
I give in, and here's my song&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
wherever you are, anywhere you go,&lt;br&gt;
whatever you do, or choose not to,&lt;br&gt;
whatever you think and however you feel,&lt;br&gt;
my love for you, it shall only grow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sweet, is the attachment,&lt;br&gt;
but let it not keep you from flying.&lt;br&gt;
the clear open sky, it's all yours&lt;br&gt;
fly! fly! fly!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
see all that you want to,&lt;br&gt;
and do all that you'd like to.&lt;br&gt;
to your hearts content, fly!&lt;br&gt;
without a care in the world, fly!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
for, if ever, you wish to rest,&lt;br&gt;
now you know, where to return&lt;br&gt;
right here, I shall be,&lt;br&gt;
with love, just a little more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Mute, I chose to be, but, boy!&lt;br&gt;
does it need to be told. All over me,&lt;br&gt;
it's written; and you, sure, read me!&lt;br&gt;
Love you, for being the more loving one!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

This post is just to keep up a promise that I made to a friend of
mine (well, actually myself).  Presently, its the placement heat
in our campus and people are busy writing tests, waiting, giving
interviews and partying. This post doesn't have much to with all
that though.  In one of the interviews, I was called back and
asked about my Cleft Lip and Palate&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/the-third-round.html#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The interview panel had
concerns if I faced any serious medical problems due to this. I
explained to them everything that I knew about it and they were
convinced.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Later, I realized, I never explicitly did any reading on this
issue or asked my parents/others about this. I somehow knew about
it always. I probably learnt at all those visits to the dentist or
may be sub-consciously, when I was a baby. It isn't, though,
surprising to me that those guys had some reservations about
it. It's not everyday that you see a guy with a Cleft, though
statistics say there's prevalence of 1 in 500 births
world-wide. As a matter of fact, I myself haven't seen another guy
all my life (except for the pictures at my dentists') (also, they
weren't too wrong in suspecting other problems, though they had
absolutely no clue about this medical condition)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are wondering what the point of this post is, it's
nothing. It's just a pointer to those interested in reading
further on Cleft Lip and Palate.
