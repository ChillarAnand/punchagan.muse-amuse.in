I have been reading a bunch of articles on the SuperMemo site (including the
&lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol.htm"&gt;original thesis&lt;/a&gt; of P. A. Wozniack, the creator of SuperMemo).  I initially
started off trying to understand the algorithms SM2,5 and 8 which org-drill
implements, but reading the articles has given me a lot of general background
and theory on how memory works, and why SuperMemo is as effective as it is (for
those who stick with it).  This blog post is an attempt to summarize and
capture what I have read in all those &lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/contents.htm"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt;, and not get lost in them.  I
would recommend reading the thesis and the suggested reading there, yourself,
but if you really don't want to – this blog post + the summary in &lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm#Prioritize"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/decalog.htm#decalog"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; would be a good alternative.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory works by repetition.  Each time you recall a fact, the time it takes
for the memory to fade increases.  Spaced repetition is the idea of repeating
items, just when you are about to forget them – trying to optimize the time
spent on learning, as well as the retention of learned material.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Prioritization of the items we need to learn is key to being able to stick to
Spaced repetition.  Beginners tend to be over-enthusiastic about the
technique and fill up their system with stuff that they don't really care
about.  Applicability of the knowledge you are trying to gain, is a good test
for whether or not it goes into your system.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Each version of SuperMemo comes with a slightly modified (on most occassions,
improved!) algorithm.  SM2, SM5, … refer to these algorithms. Org-drill
currently supports only sm2,5 and 8.  It may be worth looking at sm15/16 and
seeing if it can be implemented and is worth doing.  In any case, using any
of these is &lt;b&gt;way&lt;/b&gt; better than not using Spaced repetition at all.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Understanding what we are trying to learn goes a long way in helping
memory. It is, therefore, good to start with basic material. People have been
surprised by how easily the advanced stuff fell into place, once they had the
basics covered.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Keep items in the system simple.  Stick to the minimum information
principle.  Keeping it simple, doesn't mean you leave out on learning the
complex stuff; instead break it into simpler components.  Simpler items has
the following advantages:

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple is easier to remember.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simpler items are easier to schedule.  You get more resolution to figure
out what the problem areas are.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple makes brings in redundancy automatically.  And &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redundancy_is_good"&gt;redundancy is good&lt;/a&gt;
    for memory, just like it is for managing hardware failure.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Keep learning fun!  Don't make review sessions a chore.  Think about the
material you are reviewing. Edit/delete/improve items based on your reviews,
then and there. Stay active.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It is useful to add a link to the source of the items added to your system,
considering that you wish to use the system over a long period of time
(ideally, the rest of your life!)
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Prioritize, add examples, appeal to your emotional state, link to existing
knowledge, use images. Anything else that works for you!  Use all of these
techniques, that work well and you probably already use in everyday life, in
the items you add to your system, to make them easier to recall.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Being physically fit and healthy is important for being so
mentally. Exercise, sleep, eat well, avoid caffeine.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Try &lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm"&gt;incremental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/devour.htm"&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt;, as an input source of items into your memory system.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I like how some of the people here are taking check-ins so seriously.  A
bunch of people posted messages on Zulip, informing that they would not be
able to make it to check-ins, and seemed quite sorry about it.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check-ins are indeed useful.  At the end of every day, I review my work
wondering what I did, and sometimes end up pushing myself harder, to have
something reasonable to talk about during the check-ins!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yesterday, I read up about FFTs and ended up playing around with &lt;code&gt;fft&lt;/code&gt; in
&lt;code&gt;scipy&lt;/code&gt;, and played around with audacity, etc.  Nothing concrete, really.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a "goals" workshop by Stacey, where she talked about how to get the
most out of this batch of Hacker School, and then we split into groups of 3,
and presented our goal-statements to each other, and gave our impressions of
each others' goals.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't really have a goal, but the exercise seemed to help, anyway.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, I think it is making me nervous to treat Hacker School as
super-important.  It is important to make the best use of every hour, every
minute here, but at the same time, I shouldn't be constantly worrying about
whether or not, whatever I'm doing is the best use of my time here.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I would like to form some good habits, and make a few good friends,
more than finish projects and build something uber-cool.  Of course, it would
be great to build awesome stuff (and may be the only reasonable way to form
habits, and make friends) but I shouldn't worry too much about time running
out. Never Graduate!
&lt;/li&gt;

It was a pleasant Saturday evening in the middle of the winter. Christmas was
just round the corner and love in the air. The sun was just setting and
everything outside his window was given a fresh coat of snow, tickled by the
red, quickly fading light. Not that he noticed. He stared blankly out of the
window, looking at nothing in particular. He had just woken up from his
afternoon nap; but he'd buy it if you told him he'd been sleeping for a year…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You could see the icy river crawling ahead, from his window.  People walking
over the bridge, a few camera flashes going off, people stopping over and
looking far ahead into the horizon – collecting their thoughts, couples
walking hand-in-hand enjoying each others' company; You could see it all, from
up there! But, as they say, you only see what you look for. And he, couldn't
see any of this. His looked out of his window and saw none of this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He is walking down the same bridge. He didn't know where he was going; his head
at least. His legs did; as always. He was walking down in his regular yellow
shirt and black jeans, that you could mistake for a uniform, if you followed
him for a few days. Extremely under-dressed for the chilly night, one would
say. He kept walking down the main street, lined with shops brightly lit up for
the festive season. The pavement bustled with with people walking with a spring
in their step – the spring that the festive season and all the love in the air
brought to you. Not that he noticed it, or had any of it in his step.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Soon, he's walking through the park. The park that was built to celebrate time,
ticking away furiously. Or to celebrate the time everyone in the world had, to
enjoy themselves. He walked past the skating rink, with lots of people having
the time of their life, ice skating; and a lot more, awaiting their turn. The
first timers, old and young, making up for their inexperience, with their
excitement; holding onto whatever they can, to finish each round, to start the
next! The veterans, taking the center-stage and showing off their moves!  He
was barely aware of their presence and just walked on, past all the action.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The music festival; he walked past it too, like the crowd didn't exist, the
noise didn't, the music didn't; like there was nothing happening! The fountain
"felt" no different. The cold breeze, did sprinkle the water to quite a
distance and everybody kept a safe distance to avoid the chilling shower,
except for the kids, who found it amusing to run into the shower for a split
second and run back madly. How could he walk just by it, and not feel a thing!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The lakefront. That is where his legs always brought him in the end. The
brilliantly lit skyline was a delight to watch, but I don't believe he saw any
of it. He just stared into it, blankly. He kept staring, as the night got
chillier and the surroundings kept getting more and more deserted. Seconds
ticked away, minutes and hours passed by! He stayed on, staring ahead. It
didn't matter how much below zero the mercury had gone. This wasn't the first
night he was spending staring into the nothingness. It turned out to be the
coldest night, in a decade. But that didn't matter to him. Nothing did. Nothing
has, for a while now; Ever since he turned cold.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blab</category><category>cold</category><category>fiction</category><category>life</category><category>story</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/cold.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2013 19:33:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Just one day</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/just-one-day.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
The ripples on the quiet lake,&lt;br&gt;
twinkling stars on a moonless night,&lt;br&gt;
and his lonely, crazy, thoughts,&lt;br&gt;
yet again, his faithful companions&lt;br&gt;
on another of those countless nights,&lt;br&gt;
searching for meaning, awaiting the dawn.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the night crawled by, as he drifted afloat,&lt;br&gt;
memories of the past and dreams of the future,&lt;br&gt;
until approaching footsteps, brought him back&lt;br&gt;
did the chill of the wind, get to his head?&lt;br&gt;
or was his guarded secret, not his anymore?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Before his thoughts, collect, he could,&lt;br&gt;
his friend, from far away lands unknown,&lt;br&gt;
was there with him, to share his thoughts,&lt;br&gt;
to hear the wind hum the tunes of yore,&lt;br&gt;
while the stars and the lake, as a duo, danced.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They watch the sun rise, from atop the hillock,&lt;br&gt;
basking in the warmth, and see the town wake up,&lt;br&gt;
lose themselves in the woods below,&lt;br&gt;
on their way back, rest by the lake shore,&lt;br&gt;
watching it, silently, shine in the daylight,&lt;br&gt;
letting it wet their feet and clear his head.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Together, they cook themselves, a delicious meal,&lt;br&gt;
n enjoy it, with some of the choicest old wine.&lt;br&gt;
Catch-up on things, and yearn for more, discuss&lt;br&gt;
all the many things, under the sun, and over,&lt;br&gt;
without a clue, as to how much time flew by.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Riding away, as fast as they could, they reach,&lt;br&gt;
just in time, as the sun set, over the seas,&lt;br&gt;
perched on bicycles, in mirrored positions, with&lt;br&gt;
resonating thoughts, the horizon, they watch&lt;br&gt;
the sun set, the beach light up, and the fair begin.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They ate and drank, sung and danced and&lt;br&gt;
just had a good time, for the rest of the night,&lt;br&gt;
indulging, in all that the fair could offer.&lt;br&gt;
the night was long, but if wouldn't go on forever,&lt;br&gt;
pretty well, they knew, they day was to end.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the twinkling stars they watched, yet again,&lt;br&gt;
but to the sea's song, on the still warm sand&lt;br&gt;
slowly, but steadily, into sleep he drifted,&lt;br&gt;
only to be awake, moments later, with the&lt;br&gt;
bright sun coming harshly down upon him,&lt;br&gt;
lighting up the lake, like a carpet of jewels.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
all he had, once again, were just his thoughts,&lt;br&gt;
the lake, and not the sea, by his side,&lt;br&gt;
with fading impressions of an impossible dream&lt;br&gt;
after all, wasn't it just too much action,&lt;br&gt;
for just one day, for a life engulfed by ennui?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One some day, he told himself, and walked away.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Inspired by a friend.

the time, together spent,&lt;br&gt;
the memories cherished,&lt;br&gt;
all the love, concern and care&lt;br&gt;
may they stay with us, for life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
as high and far as you like&lt;br&gt;
may you fly, like you own the sky&lt;br&gt;
while I fumble, with my flying guide&lt;br&gt;
I see the world, through your eyes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
may you run, with all your might&lt;br&gt;
as if, fighting for life, you are.&lt;br&gt;
struggling to walk, I stumble and fall,&lt;br&gt;
but get up each time, inspired to run.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
may you, in all that we shared&lt;br&gt;
find strength to go on, if en-route&lt;br&gt;
our paths diverged; you may have to wait,&lt;br&gt;
but you shall see me, on the other side!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thanks to Chaitu, I re-read Love Unvoiced a few times and
realized, I was trying to say too much. Here's another poem,
with one part of what I wanted to say. I will not be writing
newer poems, to say the other stuff. Perform your own Fourier
analysis.

&lt;br&gt;
Hard, I tried, to stay mum,&lt;br&gt;
and keep it all within.&lt;br&gt;
But, not much longer can I stand,&lt;br&gt;
I give in, and here's my song&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
wherever you are, anywhere you go,&lt;br&gt;
whatever you do, or choose not to,&lt;br&gt;
whatever you think and however you feel,&lt;br&gt;
my love for you, it shall only grow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sweet, is the attachment,&lt;br&gt;
but let it not keep you from flying.&lt;br&gt;
the clear open sky, it's all yours&lt;br&gt;
fly! fly! fly!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
see all that you want to,&lt;br&gt;
and do all that you'd like to.&lt;br&gt;
to your hearts content, fly!&lt;br&gt;
without a care in the world, fly!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
for, if ever, you wish to rest,&lt;br&gt;
now you know, where to return&lt;br&gt;
right here, I shall be,&lt;br&gt;
with love, just a little more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Mute, I chose to be, but, boy!&lt;br&gt;
does it need to be told. All over me,&lt;br&gt;
it's written; and you, sure, read me!&lt;br&gt;
Love you, for being the more loving one!&lt;br&gt;

I'm not the body that dies&lt;br&gt;
on missing a beat or one breath.&lt;br&gt;
I'm not the mind, so fickle,&lt;br&gt;
I'm in heaven one moment, and next in hell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm the moments I live,&lt;br&gt;
not the ones, in which I just exist.&lt;br&gt;
I'm the dreams I dream,&lt;br&gt;
those fulfilled, and not just yet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am the occasions I grace&lt;br&gt;
and those, missed, where I am.&lt;br&gt;
I am the words I spoke,&lt;br&gt;
those I wrote, and those I will.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am all that I create,&lt;br&gt;
and the stuff that I catalyse.&lt;br&gt;
I am the love I receive,&lt;br&gt;
and all of it that I spread.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Don't cry, when I die,&lt;br&gt;
for I never really will.&lt;br&gt;

Come spring -&lt;br&gt;
a fresh lease of green&lt;br&gt;
drapes the bare branches.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The leaves, dancing and whistling&lt;br&gt;
to the tunes of the wind&lt;br&gt;
playing, screaming, and singing,&lt;br&gt;
in each other's company, enjoying.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Singing to one another&lt;br&gt;
promises of sticking together,&lt;br&gt;
come what may, through it all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The song goes on,&lt;br&gt;
but the count goes down,&lt;br&gt;
not noticed or just unacknowledged,&lt;br&gt;
first by one and then by many more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the song, still, goes on.&lt;br&gt;
And the promises too, of course.&lt;br&gt;
The song goes on and on and on.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Until silence falls upon, when all&lt;br&gt;
of them are gone. The tree, knowing well,&lt;br&gt;
watches on - it won't be long before&lt;br&gt;
a new bunch springs up to sing the song.&lt;br&gt;

Well, this could be called a post after ages, considering that
most of previous posts have just been 'news reports'. I have been
wanting to make a post since long, but I probably lost it. I
really am unable to write anything that I find worth posting [It
does raise questions about the existence of this blog. I'm writing
this, to answer that question to myself.]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This post is provoked by an act of sharing, an act of kindness, an
act of goodness, that surprised me. This post isn't about the act
itself, but it's about me being surprised. Why on earth should I
(or anybody) be surprised, when someone is just being human?
Aren't human beings meant to be and feel human?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wonder why people say, "this is a bad, bad world." I find a lot
of goodness and humanness around me. Unless I strain my memory
really hard, I can only recall people who try to be as good and
nice as they can be; People trying to be as human as
possible. Either there's something utterly wrong with my judgment
of people or there's something wrong with the general feeling that
the world is a bad, bad place.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There's one other possibility that just strikes me - I am so nice
to people that, everyone else tries to be nice with me. I don't
think I am such a big deviation from the average. I'm just another
goat, in the great herd.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And another one, I'm in a really special place, presently. I have
been only to the special places. I have visited only the places
that are at an extreme, far away from the 'average' place in the
world. But, given I'm just another goat in the great herd, this is
very unlikely. I am probably grazing at a random spot on the great
grasslands.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since these are ruled out, it boils down to either a wrong
judgment or a wrong general feeling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Coming to my judgment, I wouldn't call myself an Oracle or the
wise one, but I'm no dumb ass either. Well, taking the statistical
route, the number of times I've had any real "nasty" surprises in
dealing with people has been much lesser than the number of times
things turned out nearly as expected. My judgment could,
therefore, possibly given some credibility.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, that leaves me with just one possibility. The idea that the
world is a bad, bad place is not entirely true, if not completely
absurd and outright wrong. The world is really a nice place, with
"human" beings inhabiting it. The nasty surprises that you get,
really are the surprises and not the general rule.

Achieve something, I'm often reminded,&lt;br&gt;
achieve something, something that's worthwhile.&lt;br&gt;
Don't just kill time, they say,&lt;br&gt;
for, brutally, it shall kill you someday.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Make the best use of time, I tell myself,&lt;br&gt;
for I realize, how I spend my days&lt;br&gt;
is how I'm spending my life and&lt;br&gt;
I'm going to get just one of it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But, what is worthwhile, I wonder&lt;br&gt;
everything seems so good one moment&lt;br&gt;
and all meaning vanishes the very next.&lt;br&gt;
I'm utterly confused, somebody help!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Pick one from, spoke my brother,&lt;br&gt;
the 'everything' that seems good&lt;br&gt;
and do it right, just, do it right!&lt;br&gt;
Life, as you live through it, shall&lt;br&gt;
teach you to do things that are right&lt;br&gt;
and at the end of it all, you'll&lt;br&gt;
never regret what you've done&lt;br&gt;
but, only what you couldn't!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Inspired by
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a late-night conversation with a friend
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annie Dillard, "How we spend our days is, of course, how we
spend our lives"
&lt;/li&gt;
