A few days back I received a letter from a friend, via post! [I
know most of you can't believe this… but ya.. its true..] I
wouldn't have believed it too… if only he didn't tell that to me
when we met online… {He spoilt the fun for me! :-(} So before
going to dinner one day…(a couple of weeks back..).. I checked
out the Hostel Assistants room for any post…. and "it" was right
on top of the pile!! [Now that I speak of a pile don't imagine
that a lot of people here get personal letters… most of them
were business correspondence, magazines or likewise…]
Neways.. it was a great feeling to even look at it!! A white
envelope… and my name on it.. in his most familiar writing on
it…[no.. i don't get letters from him often.. we have been
classmates for quite some time.. so…] … the stamp [A leapard
cat!]… and the two postmarks.. [of Pilani &amp;amp;amp;
Zuarinagar!! :-P]… Holding the letter in my hand.. it felt
wonderful!! [I wanted to read it right then…. but went along for
dinner…]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After dinner… and a little time in the Children's
Park… [relaxing.. wid 9,UC,Voodoo n Ringo]… I opened it! It
was absolutely thrilling… to see a couple of pages written in
ink [he still uses ink pens!! ;-)]… With full enthu.. i read the
letter.. and obviously once wasn't enough to satiate my hunger.. i
went through it over and over and over… [i wanted to scribble
down a reply ASAP… but we had waves and quark coming up.. so i
waited for them to get over (I could've written another one
right??)…to get more matter into my letter..]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why is such a simple joy of getting a letter from a friend [there
is email.. but… for me its nowhere close to snail mail…]
become so rare these days?? [Something that was such a regular
feature of the recent past.. is almost extinct now!!] Telephone
and the Internet…. they are the culprits… (are they??…..) In
today's global village… is post a bit too slow for comfort? Will
survival of the fittest ensure the extiction of this wonderful
species in the world of communication…??
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Is a letter just a matter of communication…?… Isn't there
anything more to it… [Obviously there is… otherwise I wouldn't
be writing a blog-post on it…I would never think of writing a
post on an e-mail I get!! (unless it is superhuman.. or
something..)!!] Aren't we losing out on something wonderful??
&lt;/p&gt;

To attract good fortune, spend a new coin on an old friend, share
an old pleasure with a new friend, and lift up the heart of a true
friend by writing his name on the wings of a dragon.  – Chinese

The Internet is so big, so powerful and pointless that for some
people it is a complete substitute for life.  – &lt;i&gt;Andrew Brown&lt;/i&gt;
