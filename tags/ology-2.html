<b>Disambiguation:</b> The original Linux on 2 Floppies is here.
</p>

<p>
I, post this from a remastered version of Knoppix that we named
Floppix!
</p>

<p>
It all actually began, with me deciding to do a bit of Emacs-ing
at home during the winter hols but I don't have a Linux box at
home. Live-CD is the way to go! But then Emacs doesn't \*usually\*
go with Live-CDs. So I decided to get around making my own. :)
[Dunnet "Dunnet Game"),
an Adventure game in Emacs, played a crucial role in motivating me
to go ahead!] The rest as they say is history….
</p>

<p>
Actually, I tried a debootstrap from my Debian etch but I couldn't
manage to get the initrd working. [[<a href="http://avudem.blogspot.com">http://avudem.blogspot.com</a>
"Voodoo"][I ain't this geekish, its only that I am incapable of
putting these terms in a simpler language.] After numerous futile
attempt, I gave up for the time being and that's when the genius
of [Voodoo]] came in, he took a different route. Remastering
Knoppix.[Modifying an existing Live-CD of Knoppix]
</p>

<p>
I won't get into the exact details of how we got about it. There's
a lot of online help available for that.
</p>

<p>
A few highlights, for the curious reader…
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>got rid of the default KDE and replaced it with
Fluxbox. [actually Floppix = Fluxbox + Knoppix :P]
</li>
<li>added emacs, cmucl, slime, octave, linuxdcpp, vlc and others.
</li>
<li>got rid of other packages which we weren't going to use.
</li>
<li>changed the boot message
</li>
<li>changed the default background image.
</li>
<li>removed the default boot image [ couldn't change it as the image
we chose wasn't being properly converted to lss16 format ]
</li>
<li>tested the CD with Qemu [size of the iso got more than 700MB]
</li>
<li>removed a few other not so regularly used packages [including
wine!]
</li>
<li>burnt the CD
</li>
<li>Logged in!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now, that I've logged in, I realize we managed to quite a decent
job. Obviously we weren't perfect. It was the first time and done
in quite a hurry. [btw, we have our end-sems going on; I've no
exam tomorrow though] I was able to listen to music, connect to
the DC, play a game of dunnet and make a blogpost! We also missed
a few packages, for instance a screen shot capture program! But it
ain't too bad, still a long way to go though!
</p>

<p>
Just hoping we manage to make it better, as we get better at it!
;)
</p>

<p>
Here comes FloppixV0.1!
</p>


<hr>
<p>
Update [3/1/08]: I never knew that GIMP could capture screenshots!
ImageMagick can do that too. I had two programs at hand and
thought I had none! Here's a Screenshot of the Floppix Desktop.

<p>
Update 2 [4/1/08]: There is already a floppy distro of Linux
called Floppix. I knew about this only when some one searching for
it reached my blog. Guess I should do something about this. [I'll
be able to do it only after getting back to campus,though]

I had problems with this and tried quite a few things to get it
working…  [uninstalling and re-installing
packages… downloading fonts.. etc.. ] but couldn't until I found
help here…

Writing from Delhi, doing my PS at NPL! One would imagine, that I
am here enjoying myself; that I am enjoying thoroughly the
exposure I am getting to the world of Physics at a Research Level;
that I am spending each moment, inspired. But things haven't been
so rosy here… until today! [All this while I had been only doing
a lot of mechanical labor, very unhappily…]
</p>

<p>
Its around 12 noon, when I get a call, in the lab, from my guide
asking me to come down to room no. so and so. I had no idea what
that room had, or why I had been called. I enter and I am lead to
another room inside. I enter and there's a huge machine. (first
look, reminded me of Vickers' Hardness Testing Machine, that we
had in Lab at coll and I had a test on using it!) and its called a
TEM. But when I got closer, I fell in love with it! I dunno how
and why, but it looked simply amazing and extremely lovely to me
[Nothing like the Vickers' machine]. A 25 to 30 year old machine,
lots of controls all over it, lots of circuitry out in the
open… absolutely awe-inspiring..[though I knew nothing about
them.]
</p>

<p>
And then came the moment. The lights in the room were turned off,
and slowly and steadily the beam intensity of the TEM was
increased. Gradually the Greenish Fluoroscent Screen (displaying a
sample magnified X27,000) came to life… with control lights
blinking here and there… in the darkness of the room.It was
absolutely amazing; A great feeling. Though I was in there for a
very short while… an absolutely unforgettable experience; and
will remain so, for the rest of my life.
</p>

<p>
Now, it doesn't matter to me even if I don't learn much, during
the training period, I don't mind doing any kind-of mechanical
work, I don't mind not getting any results from my work,
whatever… it doesn't matter any more. This one moment; that's
all that matters.

A few days back.. we [the usual gang of Ringo,9,UC,Vudum n
me.. along with a lot of others who joined us later] were in the
park, just relaxing and having a chat… but with the others
joining us [with whom I usually don't hang around..] , the topics
discussed were quite different from those that interest me…and
we usually talk on..  I was getting bored.. but suddenly an
interesting idea popped up… the funda of living on CS.. [though
the tone in which they looked at the idea was different… I found
it interesting..]
</p>

<p>
The ppl were criticizing a guy (don't wanna name him :P) {who
hosted wierd maps with soccer and other such stuff in it..}.. the
people were imagining wild things like.. maps in which class-notes
would be read out/scrolled… maps where food items would be
displayed at lunch time.. etc.. This might look like a funny and
weird idea.. (that gave us all a nice laugh..) but it doesn't seem
ridiculous or crazy to me.. the very fact that the idea was
conceived, annihilates it ridiculousness, for me. Though such a
degree of dependence (and addiction??) may be an over exaggeration
but…
</p>

<p>
A walk in the hostel corridors any time during the night will tell
you why i say this… I can see people in every room… (literally
every one.. and mind you I am no exception to this..) stuck to
their comps doing all sorts of things… [actually not a wide
range.. its pretty predictable… :-(] and now after my comp's
network card got burnt out (…probably… thanks to the lack of
grounding in hostels) I can see it even more clearly… that
computers are ruling our lives… [at this point.. I'm confused
why I started writing this… what's it that's bugging me? I'm
definitely not against ppl using Comps.. for I love them…]
</p>

<p>
Is it that it pains me to see people use comps for stuff that's
not so technical? Does it hurt me that we have such "Powerful"
machines before us.. and all we do with them is trivial things
like chat with others or play? I don't think so… Yes, when I
read the book Hackers:Heroes of the Computer Revolution, I felt
ashamed of using my comp in a meek and powerless way… but then I
realise that they were the Hackers from the Hacker land .. and
everyone can't be one, can they? Then what's it, that bugs me?
</p>

<p>
I guess I miss the time we spent in the first (and a little of
second) semester… when very few people had comps. We had a great
time… doing other activities that were more physical… and
refreshing (than sitting in front of a comp and posting
this!!).. I miss those football tourneys we had in the
quadrangles.. I miss those "leg" cricket matches… I long for
something like the Wrestling match we [Vudum, Ravi,Thatha n me]
had in my room… I miss those thermo sessions with Vudum n
Ravi.. I miss the tuts in Ravi's room… (mind you we sometimes
studied even when there weren't exams!!) I guess I miss a lotta
things from the first sem… The time at dinner and the chats in
parks, are the only things that are still intact… [ I wouldn't
dare forget to mention our recent trip to the woods near the
lake… it was awesome!! something that we'll all cherish for
life…] I just hope we have more and more and such
moments… moments that i will cherish for life… moments.. that
"we" will cherish for life…
</p>

<p>
<b>Update</b>: I just saw Ringo's old cd of Illayaraja songs… and
 realised, I forgot to mention the wonderful time we
 [Ringo,9,Hari,UC n me..] had listening to them in Ringo's room on
 a CD player… and Ringo's mouthorgan!!!

A couple of days back.. one guy called green<sub>mamba</sub> asked me.. "Why
do you use Linux (GNU/Linux) and not Windows? What is it that
makes LinuxGNU/Linux] so special for you?" I avoided that
question then.. {I was in no mood of answering questions… Exams
had finished just the day before!!}  I am trying to answer it
now… green<sub>mamba</sub> also told me that Roopesh said, "I use it
because I can look at the source code. I am allowed to look at how
things work and fiddle with the way they work!"… I knew it
immediately that this was not the reason for me.[I rarely looked
at source code… and making changes to it.. haha..] So what is
it? I think I can answer this question if I get back to the time
when I started using Linux…[hehe.. not too long ago!! :P]
</p>

<p>
So how did I start using GNU/Linux? How did "we" first meet? It
was during last summer holidays.. that Voods sent me this link
… [I had definitely used GNU/Linux on a few occasions
before… but.. this was when I really began using it…] and
within hours I was a fan of GNU/Linux!![and Richard M Stallman
(RMS)]
</p>

<p>
So its the "philosophy"… The philosophy of Free
Software… [Free as in Freedom, not as in Free Beer…(English is
a wierd wierd Language…)]… The philosophy of Open
Source… that brought me to it… This song says it the best…

<p>
now I continue to use it.. for a variety of reasons..[they are NOT
in the order of their priority/importance]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Firstly, using Linux gives me a sense of community… a sense of
oneness [this can't happen with Windows.. because you can't
share stuff… :-(]
</li>
<li>I have begun to hate the concept of Proprietary Software… can
you believe that.. "Sharing stuff..  makes us PIRATES!!"
</li>

<li>I am a growing fan of the Command Line… It simply rocks!!
</li>

<li>There's almost no problem of Viruses/Malware.. You simply don't
need an Anti-Virus..(that needs to be updated every night.. or
u'll have nightmares…)
</li>

<li>Then there's this wonderful concept of Live-CDs.. {specially
Knoppix.. Its absolutely awesome!} It put me(us?) out of
soup… a lotta times…
</li>

<li>The fiddle factor… I have just started to fiddle with
things(…source codes… I added a small feature to my
dc-client Microdc2].. the feature of away messages.. it feels
gr8! :P)
</li>

<li>One of my best friend is using it too! [you know who…]
</li>

<li>The Mascot looks cool!! ;) [I liked the GNU mascot too! (It's on
my side-bar) ]
</li>

<li>The name "LINUX"!! [There's so many flavors(Distros) of
Linux.. that I can keep trying different ones.. all my
life :P.. presently with Slackware!]
</li>

<li>Its Fun!! and I want to use it…
</li>

<li>and finally… Windows sucks! [I don't have to use it… :P]!!
</li>
</ul>

Value your freedom or you will lose it, teaches history. "Don't
bother us with politics," respond those who don't want to learn.

When you say, "I wrote a program that crashed Windows", people
just stare at you blankly and say, "Hey, I got those with the
system, for free".  –Linus Torvalds

<p>
"What happens when you read some doc and either it doesn't answer
 your question or is demonstrably wrong? In Linux, you say "Linux
 sucks" and go read the code. In Windows/Oracle/etc you say
 "Windows sucks" and start banging your head against the wall."
