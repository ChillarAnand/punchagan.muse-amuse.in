I have been trying to get ERC working with notifications. Julien Danjou's
wonderful <a href="https://julien.danjou.info/blog/2012/erc-notifications">notifications</a> module for ERC is great, but it is annoying to get
notifications even when Emacs is in focus.
</p>

<p>
I had looked at <a href="https://github.com/eqyiel/circe-notifications/blob/master/circe-notifications.el">circe-notifications</a>, which has the feature but uses xdotool and
xprop to do it.  I was looking for something simpler, though… and it suddenly
struck me that I have an auto-save hook in Emacs that is run when I focus out
of it.  I wondered if I could disable and enable notifications on focus, and it
worked.
</p>

<p>
In case it is useful for somebody else -
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-to-list</span> <span class="ss">'erc-modules</span> <span class="ss">'notifications</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">erc-notifications-mode</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'focus-out-hook</span> <span class="ss">'erc-notifications-enable</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'focus-in-hook</span> <span class="ss">'erc-notifications-disable</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
I wonder if there are some corner cases where this doesn't work, and that's why
the author of circe-notifications chose the tools that he did.

I've been trying to use <code>org-drill</code> regularly for the last few weeks.  I don't
know how well it's been going but I have been sticking to the routine
religiously.  I haven't yet really tried out incremental reading, but in an
attempt to make it as easy as possible, I wanted to have a pdf-reader
integration, and some kind of integration with Kindle highlights.  Browser
integration is pretty straight-forward, thanks to some <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#sec-6">simple java-script</a>.
</p>

<p>
I looked for a pdf-reader with some sort of plugin support, but I found nothing
in Evince or Okular.  I thought about <code>pdfjs</code> but it seemed slightly clunky to
open pdfs in a browser, though I might shift to this if I don't like what I
finally ended up with.  Good old <code>xpdf</code> seemed to be the only pdf reader that
had some support for custom keybindings that allowed users to run external
commands.  With a <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/xpdf-capture">little Python</a>, I was able to setup a work-flow to capture
snippets from <code>xpdf</code>, to add to org-drill. Custom key-bindings somehow don't
seem to work on <code>xpdf</code> bundled on Ubuntu. So, I ended up downloading and using
the binary available on the xpdf site.
</p>

<p>
For Kindle highlights support, with minor updates to Thamer Mahmoud's <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/clip2org">clip2org</a>,
I have a simple way of getting all the "new" clippings/highlights as org-drill
headlines.  I haven't really started using this, and once I do, I may end-up
automating even the merging of these items into the org-drill notes file.  I'm
looking forward to making better use of my Kindle, with this feature!
</p>

<p>
I don't know if it would be useful to have more context information like
section titles/chapter titles when capturing from html/pdf, but it seems like
an interesting problem to try to solve.
</p>

<p>
Also, it might be easier(?) if I probably tried to have a DE level keybinding, and
some code to get selection and file name of the currently active
window/application.

I have been trying to get back to using org-mode and its clocking
functionality, more often than not.  I used to use it a lot, a few years ago,
and haven't been using it, since I had been in my last job.
</p>

<p>
To help with it, I decided to integrate clocking in and out with changing
status on Pidgin, and turning notifications on and off in Gnome.  Here's a few
lines of code that does this for me.

<a href="http://baali.muse-amuse.in">@baali</a> tried to use my code, and it turns out it didn't work for him, because I
forgot to mention that <code>(ad-activate 'org-clock-in)</code> needs to be run, after the
<code>defadvice</code> code.  I have no idea how it worked for me, without doing that.
May be because I have <code>defadvice</code> for other functions?
</p>

<p>
Also, while debugging this, I found that <code>defadvice</code> is a deprecated way of
doing this, and <code>add-function</code> is the way to go now.  But, instead of advising
the function, I decided to make use of <code>org-clock-in-hook</code>.

Here is the new code.

Org-drill is an Org-mode extension that provides spaced-repetition and
flash-card functionality.  It has a <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html">wonderful documentation on Worg</a>, but
somehow I couldn't get myself to read the whole document, and setup org-drill,
until now.
</p>

<p>
The setup is quite straight forward, once you have org-mode along with the
<code>contrib</code> packages.  Just <code>(require 'org-drill)</code>, and you are all set!  To add
a new card, all you need to do is add a <code>:drill:</code> tag to the items you wish to
"Org-drill".  You can start a review session with simply <code>M-x org-drill</code>.  You
will be shown flash cards, and you can rate how correct and comfortable you
were, in answering the questions.  Based on your responses, the cards are
scheduled for review.  Start another review session, whenever you need one!
</p>

<p>
What I could only understand once I got myself to read the whole document was
that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The default scope of a drill session is the current file.  But, you can start
sessions with scopes like current tree, current directory, or a specified
list of files. This is super-useful!
</li>

<li>The review sessions are not automatically scheduled, based on when you
schedule failed flash-cards.  Scheduling the review for a card only sets a
due-date for them, and effects, what you are asked in your next session.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Cram mode and incremental reading are also things I want to try, as I go along.
</p>

<p>
Happy Learning!

example post.

The org source for any post can be found by changing the URL of a post
from <code>.html</code> to <code>.org</code>.
</p>

<p>
I don't have much of a work-flow, because I don't post too often, but
here is what I typically do, to make a new post.
</p>

<p>
I start off by creating a new post using
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>nikola new_post
</pre></div>

<p>
and then give the post a title and start editing the post in Emacs.

<p>
I have a simple snippet that lets me insert tags, based on existing
tags.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/6629020.js"></script>

<p>
Once I'm happy with the content of a post, I run <code>nikola auto</code> to
build the source and serve it locally, and see if the post "looks"
reasonable, after being rendered.
</p>

<p>
Once, I'm happy with it, I commit the post and deploy it using <code>nikola
deploy</code>.

Well, I'm not sure if it's worth writing about.  I conducted my
first org-mode workshop along with Prof. Venkatesh Choppella at
IIIT-Hyderabad.  It was a 3 hour demo+talk kind of a thing, with a
small audience of about 20 people, most of whom were new to
Emacs.
</p>

<p>
We covered almost all the aspects of Org-mode after giving a brief
introduction to Emacs.  Outlining and note-taking part was simple
and easy to understand, but the audience couldn't really
appreciate the part of keeping TODO lists and agendas and other
stuff.  I'm hoping, the reason was not me taking over from
Venkatesh.
</p>

<p>
I think the workshop should've been more hands-on and we should've
asked people to try out stuff on the spot, instead of showing off
the things possible with Emacs.  They probably would've
appreciated a few things better, that way.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, we will be doing more workshops on Org-mode and there
are surely somethings to take away from this one.  I hope at least
one of the participants, gets hooked to Org-mode.
</p>

<p>
The talk outline is here.

eye:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The new editor has the capability to support every markup
language that GitHub Wikis support. If you're a fan of Markdown,
Textile, pod or RDoc, the function bar buttons (e.g. bold,
italic, underline, etc.) will now work. We've even written brand
new inline help for many of GitHub Wiki's supported markup
languages.
</p>

<p>
The language definitions the editor uses are JSON-based and easy
to edit. If you'd like us to support a markup language that we
don't currently support, Gollum, GitHub's wiki software, is
entirely open source – fork our code and send us a pull request
with changes that support your choice language.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I sent a quick patch for org-mode in the function bar, and it has
been accepted.  :)
</p>

<p>
If not anything more, I hope, at least a couple of curious people
will explore org-mode and find it useful.

Org-mode, as a mode, is obviously awesome.  The ability to move
around whole blocks of text, for re-organizing documents and the
usability of tables are just two brilliant features.
</p>

<p>
But, the org markup itself is such a cool thing.  I've been
looking at <code>rst</code> all day, and it's such a pain to find out where
your headings are, what level your current sub-heading is at, etc.
(I'll probably do a bit better, with some getting used to. I'm an
org-addict. ;)).  With org-mode it's so intuitive!  It's so easy
to find out, with just one quick look!  I don't think any other
markup has this coolness! Org-mode FTW!

convert markup from one to another and it does it pretty well.
Until now it supported quite a few markups, but not orgmode.  But
now, Orgmode support has been added! Yay!
</p>

<p>
But, it can only read from other formats and write to org-mode
format.  The other way around, is not possible, but you can do
that straight from org-mode, right?
</p>

I've often felt the need for an org-importer and hence decided to
do something about it.  I stumbled upon Pandoc, when I was moving
my blog, and found it pretty neat.  After, yet another request for
an importer, on the org-mode mailing list, I decided to look at
Pandoc.  I was somehow under the impression that it was written in
Python.  But it turned out, I had to learn Haskell!  A good excuse
to learn a new language, eh?  I brushed through a tutorial for a
couple of days (and was blown off by the paradigm of the language)
and was able to port the RST writer in Pandoc, to an Org
writer.  :)
