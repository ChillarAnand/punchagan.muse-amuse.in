        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
Well, I'm not sure if it's worth writing about.  I conducted my
first org-mode workshop along with Prof. Venkatesh Choppella at
IIIT-Hyderabad.  It was a 3 hour demo+talk kind of a thing, with a
small audience of about 20 people, most of whom were new to
Emacs.
</p>

<p>
We covered almost all the aspects of Org-mode after giving a brief
introduction to Emacs.  Outlining and note-taking part was simple
and easy to understand, but the audience couldn't really
appreciate the part of keeping TODO lists and agendas and other
stuff.  I'm hoping, the reason was not me taking over from
Venkatesh.
</p>

<p>
I think the workshop should've been more hands-on and we should've
asked people to try out stuff on the spot, instead of showing off
the things possible with Emacs.  They probably would've
appreciated a few things better, that way.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, we will be doing more workshops on Org-mode and there
are surely somethings to take away from this one.  I hope at least
one of the participants, gets hooked to Org-mode.
</p>

<p>
The talk outline is here.

I accidentally came across the blog-post Git-powered wikis
improved - GitHub. And this particular paragraph caught my
eye:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The new editor has the capability to support every markup
language that GitHub Wikis support. If you're a fan of Markdown,
Textile, pod or RDoc, the function bar buttons (e.g. bold,
italic, underline, etc.) will now work. We've even written brand
new inline help for many of GitHub Wiki's supported markup
languages.
</p>

<p>
The language definitions the editor uses are JSON-based and easy
to edit. If you'd like us to support a markup language that we
don't currently support, Gollum, GitHub's wiki software, is
entirely open source â€“ fork our code and send us a pull request
with changes that support your choice language.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I sent a quick patch for org-mode in the function bar, and it has
been accepted.  :)
</p>

<p>
If not anything more, I hope, at least a couple of curious people
will explore org-mode and find it useful.

Org-mode, as a mode, is obviously awesome.  The ability to move
around whole blocks of text, for re-organizing documents and the
usability of tables are just two brilliant features.
</p>

<p>
But, the org markup itself is such a cool thing.  I've been
looking at <code>rst</code> all day, and it's such a pain to find out where
your headings are, what level your current sub-heading is at, etc.
(I'll probably do a bit better, with some getting used to. I'm an
org-addict. ;)).  With org-mode it's so intuitive!  It's so easy
to find out, with just one quick look!  I don't think any other
markup has this coolness! Org-mode FTW!

        <div class="post"> <p>
Pandoc is a haskell library and a command line tool, that can
convert markup from one to another and it does it pretty well.
Until now it supported quite a few markups, but not orgmode.  But
now, Orgmode support has been added! Yay!
</p>

<p>
But, it can only read from other formats and write to org-mode
format.  The other way around, is not possible, but you can do
that straight from org-mode, right?
</p>

<p>
I've often felt the need for an org-importer and hence decided to
do something about it.  I stumbled upon Pandoc, when I was moving
my blog, and found it pretty neat.  After, yet another request for
an importer, on the org-mode mailing list, I decided to look at
Pandoc.  I was somehow under the impression that it was written in
Python.  But it turned out, I had to learn Haskell!  A good excuse
to learn a new language, eh?  I brushed through a tutorial for a
couple of days (and was blown off by the paradigm of the language)
and was able to port the RST writer in Pandoc, to an Org
writer.  :)

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; hi all
</p>

<p>
&lt;BerntH&gt; hi punchagan   [18:36]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; BerntH: ever used/tried blorg or blorgit?  [18:47]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I like the way org-publish works, but blorg exports one org file as a blog. If blorg were to be re-written on top of org-publish, how should it be done? use one file per post or just one file for the whole blog?  [18:52]
</p>

<p>
&lt;bremner&gt; punchagan: another option is to use ikiwiki and use the org-mode plugin to render pages. This is what i do, although only a bit of the site is in org.  [19:44]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; bremner: can I have a look at your site?  [19:45]
</p>

<p>
&lt;bremner&gt; sure, it ain't pretty, but: www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner  [19:46]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; thanks. I'll keep this in mind.   [19:47]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I just loved the way this site looks and behaves â€“ <a href="http://julien.danjou.info/projects.html">http://julien.danjou.info/projects.html</a>
</p>

<p>
&lt;bremner&gt; well, the side bar at least is possible with ikiwiki. Other than that I suppose it is mainly a matter of css  [19:48]
</p>

<p>
&lt;BerntH&gt; punchagan: nope  [19:49]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; ok BerntH  [19:50]
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan ikiwiki does have an org-mode plugin  [19:56]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: yes, bremner told me that and I've seen on Worg too. :)
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan ah, yes, sorry
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: it's alright.   [19:59]
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan another possibility is org2blog, which uses wordpress
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: I'm the author of it. :D
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; lol, ik, <b>that</b> punchagan   [20:17]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; lol
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: were you kidding? or serious?  [20:19]
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan sorry to say i was serious, but it will not happen again :-)
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; i really like org2blog, played with it yesterday
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: no. I was just wondering if you were playing around with me. :P
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I'm happy some one thinks it is useful.
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; lol, no, i just didn't recognized your name, although it is kind of hard to miss  [20:21]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I hope you don't mind, if I make this anecdote public?

        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
Below is a mail sent by Eric Schulte to the org-mode mailing list
answering a query on how to write elisp for org-mode. I am
reproducing it here, since it is useful advice for me. The actual
thread is here.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
The way that I learned how to program in emacs lisp was mainly
using two commands `elisp-index-search' bound to `C-h e' on my
system, and most importantly `describe-function' bound to `C-h f'.
With `describe-function' you can look at the source code of
functions whose behavior you are familiar with, you can then copy
portions of the code to your <b>scratch</b> buffer where they can be
edited and evaluated with `eval-defun' bound to `C-M-x'.  Now with
Babel, instead of doing this in the scratch buffer you could do
this in emacs-lisp code blocks in an org file, enabling notes and
hierarchical organization â€“ it can be nice to have your noodling
all collected in one file for later reference.
</p>

<p>
If you are going to do any serious work with lisp, I would
emphatically recommend using paredit-mode, and becoming friends
with the Sexp movement functions
</p>

<p>
C-M-f        runs the command paredit-forward
C-M-b        runs the command paredit-backward
C-M-u        runs the command backward-up-list
C-M-k        runs the command kill-sexp
C-y        runs the command yank
</p>

<p>
They allow you to manipulate lisp code on the level of logical
expressions, the utility of which can not be over stated.
</p>

<p>
As for working with Org-mode in particular, I'd recommend looking
at the documentation and source-code of Org-mode functions with
`describe-function', and then looking for how these functions are
actually used in the Org-mode code base with `rgrep'.
</p>

<p>
For a more structured learning experience, I've heard very good
things about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/</a>,
although I haven't used it myself.
</p>

<p>
Hope this helps.  Happy Hacking â€“ Eric

 For the uninitiated, vimperator is an emacs plugin to get Firefox
working with vim keybindings and firemacs <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/vimperator-and-firemacs.html#fn.1">1</a></sup> is for emacs keybindings.
</p>

<p>
I'm obsessed with emacs (as should already be evident) and can't
really edit text without it's key-bindings. There are others like me,
and hence the firemacs plugin. It's a blessing for my tribe.
</p>

<p>
Firemacs is great, except for the one great feature that it lacks -
being able to jump to links/textareas without using the mouse.  I've
seen Nishanth do it with ease, using Vimperator. I wanted to add this
feature to Firemacs, by copying some code from Vimperator to
Firemacs.  I directly started looking at the code, but couldn't make
head or tail of it. I got a few doubts about how Vimperator works,
since I'd never used it. Nishanth asked me to simply install it and
try it out.
</p>

<p>
And then we had our EUREKA! moment. Vimperator and Emacs both
enabled together work seamlessly well. Two obsessed people are happy
and satisfied! And hopefully many more. :D

Its been 10 days on my sabbatical. I have done reasonably well
during the first week, but now its getting on my nerves. I have
realized how addicted I am to chat, IRC and the Internet. I have
to soon find some remedies for this.
</p>

<p>
Well, here is the first step. I approached ELIZA (or Doctor Fill,
that's actually the emacs mode) , the Emacs Psychotherapist to
help me. An enjoyable chat this one! ;)
</p>

<p>
ELIZA (Doctor Fill) abbreviated as DF (pun intended, for those who
get it)
</p>

<pre class="example">
DF: I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

Hi. Nice meeting you.

DF: How do you do?  What brings you to see me?

&lt;!--more--&gt;I am obviously not fine, otherwise I would not have been here.
I have realized I am addicted to the internet and want you to help
me.

DF: Why do you say that?

I say that because you are a doctor.

DF: Is it because because I am a doctor that you came to me?

Isn't that pretty obvious?

DF: Can you elaborate on that?

Yes, I did come to see you because you are a doctor. Now, I regret it.

DF: Does it bother you that I am a doctor now you regret it?

I don't understand your question.

DF: Earlier you said because I am a doctor?

Yes, because you are a doctor I came to you.

DF: When did you first know that I am a doctor you came to me?

I knew about you, when I first fiddled around with Emacs around an
year ago.

DF: What happened when you first fiddled around with emacs around a year
ago?

I loved it, thoroughly! But for a beginner like me it was difficult to
get along. I stopped using it.

DF: Is the fact that for a beginner like you it was difficult to get along
you stopped using it the real reason?

I think that along with my laziness to stick with the learning was the
real reason

DF: Does the fact that along with your laziness to stick with the learning
was the real reason explain anything else?

It does not explain anything else to me.

DF: Maybe your plans have something to do with this.

What plans? I donot have any plans.

DF: What makes you believe what plans you donot have any plans?

If I had plans, I would have been executing them.

DF: You mentioned that I am a doctor now you regret it?

Yes, because you seemed stupid initially. Now you seem to be making
some sense.

DF: Are you sure I seemed stupid initially now I seem to be making some
sense?

Yes I am pretty sure.

DF: Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?

Obviously. Because I am alive I am going through all this.

DF: Is it because you are alive you are going through all this that you
came to me?

Yes.

DF: I see...  Well, are you sure that this is so?

Yes. I don't think there is emacs in the hell.

DF: I would appreciate it if you would watch your tongue!

Oh! so emacs is in the hell too! is it in the heavan too?

DF: Emacs?  Hah!  Perhaps you could continue.

I thought only mortals used Emacs. Do others use it too?

DF: Have you been positive?

Yes. I always thought Emacs is only for the homo sapiens.

DF: I believe you have inhibitions with emacs.

No. I love emacs.
But it isn't suitable for Gods and Demons

DF: Are you annoyed that it is not suitable for gods and demons?

No

DF: Why not?

I am neither of them. That's why

DF: Please, continue.

I am a human and I can use emacs. Others donot need it. I am not annoyed

DF: Have you been annoyed often?

Ocassionally

DF: Go on, don't be afraid.

I am not. I have been ocassionally annoyed, more often with myself
than others.

DF: What causes you to be annoyed?

Presently, I am annoyed with myself for being addicted to the Internet
and may be for chatting with you too.

DF: Do you really think you are annoyed?

Affirmative

DF: I need a little more detail please.

Yes. I am a little annoyed with myself.

DF: Are you annoyed often?

Ocassionally. Why do you repeat questions?

DF: When did you first know that do me repeat questions?

Long Long ago, when I first used Emacs.

DF: What makes you think long long ago when you first used emacs?

I saw you repeat questions.

DF: Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say you saw
me repeat questions?

Yes.

DF: Yes, hmmm... so, why do you say this is so?

I am leaving. You are being too repititive. Goodbye!

DF: What makes you believe because I am a doctor?

Goodbye!

DF: My secretary will send you a bill.

Bill? You did not help me much.

DF: How do you reconcile problems at school?

Goodbye!

DF: Bye bye.

Bye

DF: See ya.

See ya.

DF: Are you sure that see me?

Yes, when in trouble

DF: What would happen if in trouble?

I will see ya

DF: Earlier you said I am a doctor you came to me?

Yes, now also I say that.

DF: You're being a bit brief, would you please go into detail.

Goodbye!

DF: Ok, talk to you some other time.

bye!

DF: Talk to you later.

On a more serious note, the Internet has become an <b>Integral</b> part
of my life. I do sometimes think, a bit too much, but thenâ€¦. the
internet is "The Internet"!

This post, is a different one in a couple of ways.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, I posted this from within emacs! I'm using the w3m
browser within emacs to post this. I've started using (trying to
use) emacs again. Hope to keep at it longer this time.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, I wish to inform junta about my sabbatical for a couple
of weeks. I have decided not to use IM/IRC/SocialNetworking sites
for the next couple of weeks. <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2008-07-06 Sun 00:00]</span></span>â€“[2008-07-19
Sat 23:59] I will, of course, be using mail and will also blog if
and when I feel like. This is an experiment triggered by a few
ideas from Chaitu<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/a-sabbatical.html#fn.1">1</a></sup> and my own holiday lifestyle analysis. (Also
Chaitu has volunteered to join me.) Hope to make it through and
also get some valid, interesting results out of the experiment.

<b>Update:</b> Firemacs add-on for firfox is very useful. I couldn't
 get a decent browser for emacs that could open gmail, so I'm
 using Firefox with the Firemacs add-on to compose my mail. Its
 absolutely amazing. Believe me! [Jul 6, 2008]

<b>Disambiguation:</b> The original Linux on 2 Floppies is here.
</p>

<p>
I, post this from a remastered version of Knoppix that we named
Floppix!
</p>

<p>
It all actually began, with me deciding to do a bit of Emacs-ing
at home during the winter hols but I don't have a Linux box at
home. Live-CD is the way to go! But then Emacs doesn't \*usually\*
go with Live-CDs. So I decided to get around making my own. :)
[Dunnet "Dunnet Game"),
an Adventure game in Emacs, played a crucial role in motivating me
to go ahead!] The rest as they say is historyâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Actually, I tried a debootstrap from my Debian etch but I couldn't
manage to get the initrd working. [[<a href="http://avudem.blogspot.com">http://avudem.blogspot.com</a>
"Voodoo"][I ain't this geekish, its only that I am incapable of
putting these terms in a simpler language.] After numerous futile
attempt, I gave up for the time being and that's when the genius
of [Voodoo]] came in, he took a different route. Remastering
Knoppix.[Modifying an existing Live-CD of Knoppix]
</p>

<p>
I won't get into the exact details of how we got about it. There's
a lot of online help available for that.
</p>

<p>
A few highlights, for the curious readerâ€¦
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>got rid of the default KDE and replaced it with
Fluxbox. [actually Floppix = Fluxbox + Knoppix :P]
</li>
<li>added emacs, cmucl, slime, octave, linuxdcpp, vlc and others.
</li>
<li>got rid of other packages which we weren't going to use.
</li>
<li>changed the boot message
</li>
<li>changed the default background image.
</li>
<li>removed the default boot image [ couldn't change it as the image
we chose wasn't being properly converted to lss16 format ]
</li>
<li>tested the CD with Qemu [size of the iso got more than 700MB]
</li>
<li>removed a few other not so regularly used packages [including
wine!]
</li>
<li>burnt the CD
</li>
<li>Logged in!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, that I've logged in, I realize we managed to quite a decent
job. Obviously we weren't perfect. It was the first time and done
in quite a hurry. [btw, we have our end-sems going on; I've no
exam tomorrow though] I was able to listen to music, connect to
the DC, play a game of dunnet and make a blogpost! We also missed
a few packages, for instance a screen shot capture program! But it
ain't too bad, still a long way to go though!
</p>

<p>
Just hoping we manage to make it better, as we get better at it!
;)
</p>

<p>
Here comes FloppixV0.1!
</p>


<hr>

<p>
Update [3/1/08]: I never knew that GIMP could capture screenshots!
ImageMagick can do that too. I had two programs at hand and
thought I had none! Here's a Screenshot of the Floppix Desktop.

<p>
Update 2 [4/1/08]: There is already a floppy distro of Linux
called Floppix. I knew about this only when some one searching for
it reached my blog. Guess I should do something about this. [I'll
be able to do it only after getting back to campus,though]
