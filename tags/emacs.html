Another post about blogging.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/CodeFalling/blog-admin">blog-admin</a> now supports <a href="http://getnikola.com">Nikola</a>, thanks to yours truly. <code>blog-admin</code> is an Emacs
package by <a href="https://twitter.com/codefalling">CodeFalling</a> that lets you view and manage your (static site
generated) blog from within inside Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Nikola's command line utility is pretty nifty and does a bunch of useful
things. I had a few utility functions to do common tasks like create new post
and deploy blog. This worked well, but moment I came across this <code>blog-admin</code>'s
tabular view, I was sold!
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog">org2blog</a> (a blogging tool I used previously) had a tracking file that kept
track of all the posts I made, and I used it quite a bit for navigation –
thanks to <code>org-mode</code>'s search functionality. The tabular view of <code>blog-admin</code>
is even better!  I really like the fact that the author has tried to keep the
package generic enough to support any blog, and adding support for Nikola has
been quite easy.
</p>

<p>
The filtering functionality is crude, but good enough for a start. One thing I
want to add is a preview functionality for drafts. Showing some (writing)
statistics would also be nice – No. posts in the last month, total published
posts, etc.  No promises, but you may see some of these things, soon. :)
</p>

    </article><article class="h-entry post-text"><header><h1 class="post-title p-name entry-title"><a href="/posts/clock-in-and-get-shit-done.html" class="u-url">Clock in and get-shit-done</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">22 Dec 2015</span>
    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
I had <a href="/posts/simple-org-clock-and-gnomepidgin-integration.html">setup</a> a couple of hooks about an year ago that turn off all notifications
while I'm clocking in. But, I find myself switching to the browser and jumping
to twitter, out of habit.  I've tried <a href="https://github.com/leftnode/get-shit-done">get-shit-done</a> in the past to help myself
break this habit. But enabling get-shit-done manually is step that quickly
became a non-habit.
</p>

<p>
So, I hooked up get-shit-done into an <code>org-clock-in-hook</code>.  The snippet below
is what I added into a function that is added to this hook.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">with-temp-buffer</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">cd</span> <span class="s">"/sudo::/"</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">shell-command</span> <span class="s">"HOME=/home/punchagan get-shit-done work"</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
<code>get-shit-done</code> needs to be run as <code>root</code>, since it does things like modifying
<code>/etc/hosts</code> and restarting networking.  Just calling <code>get-shit-done</code> as a
shell command fails with the error <code>sudo: no tty present and no askpass program
specified</code>.  I found a couple of ways to fix this. The snippet above
piggy-backs on tramp to allow for a way to enter the password for <code>sudo</code> to
use. This also means that I don't need to enter the password, as long as the
tramp connection is alive.
</p>

<p>
For someone worried about having such an easy way of running something as
<code>root</code>, using something like <code>gnome-ssh-askpass</code> as the askpass program might
work better.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">shell-command</span> <span class="s">"SUDO_ASKPASS=\"/usr/lib/openssh/gnome-ssh-askpass\" get-shit-done work"</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2015</span>
    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
I have started to use <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>'s <code>unread</code> tag as my to-read list.  It has a
bookmark-let that works pretty well for adding stuff into my "to-read" list.  I
then catch up on this list using <code>elfeed</code> and subscribing to the unread items'
RSS feed.  The work-flow is pretty nice for adding stuff into the list, and
finding items on the list. But, when it comes to the actual reading part, the
entries in the feed don't have the actual content I want to read, and I end up
opening the links in a browser.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by a <a href="https://github.com/sursh/blaggregator/pull/80#issuecomment-165849126">comment from FiloSottile</a>, I realized it should be pretty easy to
setup a hook that fetches the actual content to make my reading work-flow
smoother. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/dot-files/blob/master/bin/get_article.py">small script</a>, using <a href="https://github.com/buriy/python-readability">python-readability</a>, to fetch the page
content, given a URL. This script is then hooked onto <code>elfeed-new-entry-hook</code>,
to fetch content of for new entries as they are fetched.  All the old entries
can be easily fixed with a single call to <code>elfeed-apply-hooks-now</code>.

    <p>
Staying in touch with people is something I'm not very good at.  Since I am not
on popular (among my friends/family) networks – FB and Whatsapp – I don't
even see random updates from people, to get some sense of being in touch.
</p>

<p>
I recently read some old posts by Sacha Chua and was inspired by how much code
she had for <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/geek/emacs/bbdb/">contact management</a> in her old blog posts.  I was inspired by <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2005/05/keeping-in-touch/">this
post</a> in particular to try and be more meticulous about how I stay in touch with
people. Michael Fogleman <a href="https://mwfogleman.github.io/posts/08-01-2015-emacs-can-keep-in-touch.html">blogged</a> about his contact management work-flow using
<code>keepintouch</code>. It seemed to do most of what I wanted, but I wanted this to be
integrated with my <code>org-contacts-db</code> and I felt having native elisp code would
make it easier to hook up email, chat, etc. to this.
</p>

<p>
I ended up writing a small utility called <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/howdy/">howdy</a> to help me keep in touch with
people. It currently has only a couple of features:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<code>M-x howdy</code> lets me update the last contacted timestamp for a contact.
</li>
<li>Shows me contacts that I'm out of touch in the agenda, once I add the
following snippet to an agenda file.
<div class="highlight"><pre>* Howdy
  %%(howdy-howdy)
</pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I also have a few hooks to hook up jabber messages and email to update the db.
I've added them to <code>howdy-hooks.el</code> in case anybody else wants to use them.
They can also be used as examples to write other hooks. Feel free to contribute
other hooks or suggest improvements.  The library also ships with a modest test
suite, that will hopefully make it easier for others to contribute.
</p>

<p>
I'm looking forward to experimenting with this over the next few weeks and
improving it. Hopefully, it'll help me keep in touch, better than I do now.

I've started using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/np1/mps-youtube/">mpsyt</a> to play any music from youtube, since
I'm not really interested in the video.  But, since I use emacs for chat/IRC, I
end up getting youtube links into emacs and opening them opens them up in my
browser. I ended up writing some <code>elisp</code> to play the songs from within an
instance of <code>mpsyt</code> running inside an emacs buffer.

The current version of mpsyt crashes when run from inside emacs due to a bug in
the code to get the terminal size, which should be fixed once this <a href="https://github.com/np1/mps-youtube/pull/247">patch</a> is
merged.
</p>

<p>
I would've expected <code>thing-at-point-url-at-point</code> to be able to find urls even
when they don't have a schema, but it tries to guess the schema from urls and
fails to work when the url starts with <code>youtube.com</code> instead of
<code>www.youtube.com</code>.
</p>

<p>
I started off using the command-line interface of <code>mpsyt</code> by running it using
<code>shell-command</code> or <code>start-process</code>.  But, it seemed useful to have a buffer of
<code>mpsyt</code> to switch to – easier to search for new music, repeating songs, etc.
Not all tasks/actions are achievable through <code>mpsyt</code>'s command line args.

I ended up writing more code than I thought I would have to<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/playing-music-using-mpsyt-from-emacs.html#fn.1">1</a></sup>.  But, I'm
pretty happy with how this all works, right now.

    <p>
Those who read the <a href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/learning-to-use-org-drill.html">last</a> <a href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/learning-about-spaced-repetition-supermemo-org-drill-et-al.html">few</a> <a href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/more-input-sources-for-org-drill.html">posts</a> here, would know that I have been
experimenting with <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html">org-drill</a> (a spaced repetition extension to <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>).  I
have been using the system (almost) religiously for the past 2 months, and I do
find that it has helped a great deal! (in some respects).  I have also spent a
considerable amount of time trying to reduce the friction to put new stuff into
the system, and am constantly on the look out for further improvements.
</p>

<p>
Using this system has definitely helped with retention, and I find that I can
recall quite a few things I have read a few weeks ago, that I would normally
have been unable to. Though, I can recall a lot of information, I have been
having a feeling of "fragmentation": the feeling of just retaining individual
bits/fragments of information, while losing out on actually internalizing the
knowledge; not seeing the big picture, etc.
</p>

<p>
Wozniak (the author of super-memo) <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm">warns against</a> learning without
understanding, and memorizing before actually learning stuff.  I haven't
consciously added stuff into the system that I didn't understand (when I added
it), but, later it does feel like I have lost some connections or the
understanding, and am only holding onto the fragments of information.
</p>

<p>
The problems as explained in (read: as interpreted by me from) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013/ref=sr_1_1/188-6768042-2821103?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421439099&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=make+it+stick&amp;pebp=1421439103302&amp;peasin=674729013">Make it Stick</a>
appear to be:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The understanding (if any) at the time of adding stuff into the
spaced-repetition system is untested.  It may just be familiarity
masquerading as understanding.
</li>

<li>The lack of any spaced repetitions for the overall concept/understanding and
actual repetitions only for individual bits doesn't help retention of the
understanding (even if there was any, in the first place).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
To work around this, I'm going to try adding questions that test understanding,
to the system.  The Super-memo team strongly recommends keeping the drill items
small and easy to answer.  This may be helpful in keeping each drill session
short, but I would really like to add conceptual questions to the system, and
see how it goes. I hacked <code>org-drill</code> to allow me to type out answers, before
looking at the "correct" ones.  This is an adaptation of a system that a fellow
Hacker Schooler uses, and shared.  Also, hopefully forcing myself to type out
the answer will help me get around the problem of sometimes saying "yeah I know
that", then looking at the answer only to reaffirm the feeling of familiarity,
rather than actually testing myself.  I'm still going to continue adding quick
and short questions that test "bits of information", though. But, hopefully the
additional conceptual questions are going to tie things together and help fill
in the gaps.  Lets see how this goes!
</p>

<p>
For those interested, my hacks to <code>org-drill</code> below.  The code is really a
hack, and welcome any suggestions on cleaning up the code.

        <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2015</span>
    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
I learnt to use Emacs' profiler yesterday, after many hours of yak-shaving,
trying to get <a href="https://github.com/novoid/Memacs">Memacs</a> working.  Memacs is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">memory extension</a> system for Emacs
written by Karl Voit, that I have been meaning to try out for a long time now.
Seeing lots of review posts at the turn of the year and watching Karl's recent
<a href="http://emacslife.com/emacs-chats/chat-karl-voit.html">Emacs Chat with Sacha Chua</a> pushed me to try and finally set it up.
</p>

<p>
I started writing a <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/Memacs/blob/chrome/memacs/chromium.py">module</a> to create a Memacs file – an org archive file –
from my browser history.  It was pretty easy to write, and I had it spitting
out a huge file with 22k entries after about a couple of hours of work.  Then I
excitedly pulled up my agenda, and turned on the option to view archived
entries, only to be super-disappointed.  It turned out to be extremely slow!
Actually, the agenda never came up with the 22k entries file that I had. At
least not in 5 or so minutes, before I got impatient.  The performance was
unacceptable even when I reduced it to 5k entries.
</p>

<p>
I was pretty sure it wasn't that slow for Karl in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaKPr4J0K2I#t=999">demo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/punchagan/status/550723377871065088">tweeted</a> to him,
asking for a workaround. Meanwhile, I looked at his dot-emacs, but wasn't able
to dig out what was needed to speed up things. He confirmed that his
performance was way better than what I was getting.
</p>

<p>
First, I ruled out the possibility of it being because of the SSD, since
clearly my CPU usage was peaking, and the task was CPU bound and not I/O.
Next, I tried using the same file on a different machine (with a different
version of Emacs and org-mode), and it worked blazingly fast.  So, it was
either the version of Emacs or org-mode that I was using.
</p>

<p>
I should have stopped, thought clearly, and started experimenting with org
version, but hindsight is 20-20.  I tried Ubuntu's pre-built Emacs and agendas
were fast!  I suspected my Emacs build, since I recently started building Emacs
from git.  I built two or three other versions of Emacs, and wasted a lot of
time, before realizing that I wasn't using the org-mode source bundled inside
Emacs for the tests, and there were two "independent" variables.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I began bisecting org-mode's source and found that all hell broke
loose with an <a href="http://orgmode.org/w/?p=org-mode.git;a=commitdiff;h=b88c5464db2cb0d90d4f30e43b5e08d2b1c1fcea;hp=8cc4e09950594b2abec2502e9218318570595ac5">inconspicuous change</a> around release 8.2.6.  It turns out that
org-overview was broken before this, and collapsing all the trees in a newly
opened org-buffer (default option) wasn't working. Once this bug was fixed,
opening huge org files would slow down by a great deal, in turn causing agenda
generation to be unbearably slow.
</p>

<p>
All I had to do was add a <code>#+STARTUP: showeverything</code> to the top of the file.
This speeded up things by about 50 times!  It turns out, I later found out,
that all of this is documented on <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html">Worg</a>. I did try a few search engine queries,
but sadly none of them brought this up.  Adding the following to my config,
speeded up agenda generation by about 150-200 times!
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-agenda-inhibit-startup</span> <span class="no">t</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;; ~50x speedup</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;; 3-4x speedup</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
In the course of all this debugging, I learnt how to use Emacs' profiler.  The
profile reports along with git bisect, eventually helped me figure out what the
problem was.
</p>

<p>
To profile the CPU usage, all you have to do is add a call like
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">profiler-start</span> <span class="ss">'cpu</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1">;; or M-x profiler-start</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
at the place where you wish to start it.  Emacs will then start collecting
information about where time is being spent, by sampling every
<code>sampling-interval</code> seconds (default 10<sup>6</sup> nanoseconds = 1 milli second).
</p>

<p>
You can view the information being collected, at any point of time using
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">profiler-report</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;; or M-x profiler-report</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The report is a nice, interactive tree with the percentage of time spent in
each call. You can stop profiling by calling <code>(profiler-stop)</code>.  If you have
more than one report, you can compare them by hitting <code>=</code> in one of the report
buffers.  I'm definitely going to use this for other things! (like speeding up
my startup?)
</p>

<p>
Now that I have Memacs working with reasonably fast agenda views, I'm looking
forward to collecting as much personal information as I can!  Thanks Karl for
writing Memacs.  I am going to be a pretty heavy user, I think!  There seem to
be a few rough edges, though, and I hope to help smoothen them out a little
bit, over the next few weeks.

    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
I've always wanted to be able to queue up messages to send to friends, until I
go online the next time.  I tried using email instead of chat a few times, or
just ended up staying online with a busy status.
</p>

<p>
Finally, now that I have started using jabber-mode for chatting from within
Emacs, I took out the time to write a "queuing system" for sending chat
messages, similar to the mail queue for smtpmail.  Instead of persisting sexps,
though, I persist the messages in a JSON format and the queue is flushed every
time I connect to jabber, in a <code>jabber-post-connect-hook</code>.
</p>

<p>
To make the interface as similar to the interface available when I am online, I
hacked completion for the to ID using email addresses in my address book
(<code>mu4e~contact-list</code>).  I really like the fact that the chat buffer opens up,
and I can type and send messages like I usually do.  Hitting <code>RET</code> after typing
a message queues it up, instead of trying to send it. Smooth!

I have been trying to get ERC working with notifications. Julien Danjou's
wonderful <a href="https://julien.danjou.info/blog/2012/erc-notifications">notifications</a> module for ERC is great, but it is annoying to get
notifications even when Emacs is in focus.
</p>

<p>
I had looked at <a href="https://github.com/eqyiel/circe-notifications/blob/master/circe-notifications.el">circe-notifications</a>, which has the feature but uses xdotool and
xprop to do it.  I was looking for something simpler, though… and it suddenly
struck me that I have an auto-save hook in Emacs that is run when I focus out
of it.  I wondered if I could disable and enable notifications on focus, and it
worked.
</p>

<p>
In case it is useful for somebody else -

<p>
I wonder if there are some corner cases where this doesn't work, and that's why
the author of circe-notifications chose the tools that he did.

I've been trying to use <code>org-drill</code> regularly for the last few weeks.  I don't
know how well it's been going but I have been sticking to the routine
religiously.  I haven't yet really tried out incremental reading, but in an
attempt to make it as easy as possible, I wanted to have a pdf-reader
integration, and some kind of integration with Kindle highlights.  Browser
integration is pretty straight-forward, thanks to some <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#sec-6">simple java-script</a>.
</p>

<p>
I looked for a pdf-reader with some sort of plugin support, but I found nothing
in Evince or Okular.  I thought about <code>pdfjs</code> but it seemed slightly clunky to
open pdfs in a browser, though I might shift to this if I don't like what I
finally ended up with.  Good old <code>xpdf</code> seemed to be the only pdf reader that
had some support for custom keybindings that allowed users to run external
commands.  With a <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/xpdf-capture">little Python</a>, I was able to setup a work-flow to capture
snippets from <code>xpdf</code>, to add to org-drill. Custom key-bindings somehow don't
seem to work on <code>xpdf</code> bundled on Ubuntu. So, I ended up downloading and using
the binary available on the xpdf site.

For Kindle highlights support, with minor updates to Thamer Mahmoud's <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/clip2org">clip2org</a>,
I have a simple way of getting all the "new" clippings/highlights as org-drill
headlines.  I haven't really started using this, and once I do, I may end-up
automating even the merging of these items into the org-drill notes file.  I'm
looking forward to making better use of my Kindle, with this feature!

I don't know if it would be useful to have more context information like
section titles/chapter titles when capturing from html/pdf, but it seems like
an interesting problem to try to solve.

Also, it might be easier(?) if I probably tried to have a DE level keybinding, and
some code to get selection and file name of the currently active
window/application.
