    <p>
Well, this could be called a post after ages, considering that
most of previous posts have just been 'news reports'. I have been
wanting to make a post since long, but I probably lost it. I
really am unable to write anything that I find worth posting [It
does raise questions about the existence of this blog. I'm writing
this, to answer that question to myself.]
</p>

<p>
This post is provoked by an act of sharing, an act of kindness, an
act of goodness, that surprised me. This post isn't about the act
itself, but it's about me being surprised. Why on earth should I
(or anybody) be surprised, when someone is just being human?
Aren't human beings meant to be and feel human?
</p>

<p>
I wonder why people say, "this is a bad, bad world." I find a lot
of goodness and humanness around me. Unless I strain my memory
really hard, I can only recall people who try to be as good and
nice as they can be; People trying to be as human as
possible. Either there's something utterly wrong with my judgment
of people or there's something wrong with the general feeling that
the world is a bad, bad place.
</p>

<p>
There's one other possibility that just strikes me - I am so nice
to people that, everyone else tries to be nice with me. I don't
think I am such a big deviation from the average. I'm just another
goat, in the great herd.
</p>

<p>
And another one, I'm in a really special place, presently. I have
been only to the special places. I have visited only the places
that are at an extreme, far away from the 'average' place in the
world. But, given I'm just another goat in the great herd, this is
very unlikely. I am probably grazing at a random spot on the great
grasslands.
</p>

<p>
Since these are ruled out, it boils down to either a wrong
judgment or a wrong general feeling.
</p>

<p>
Coming to my judgment, I wouldn't call myself an Oracle or the
wise one, but I'm no dumb ass either. Well, taking the statistical
route, the number of times I've had any real "nasty" surprises in
dealing with people has been much lesser than the number of times
things turned out nearly as expected. My judgment could,
therefore, possibly given some credibility.
</p>

<p>
So, that leaves me with just one possibility. The idea that the
world is a bad, bad place is not entirely true, if not completely
absurd and outright wrong. The world is really a nice place, with
"human" beings inhabiting it. The nasty surprises that you get,
really are the surprises and not the general rule.

<blockquote>
<p>
Our design of this introductory computer-science subject
reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the
idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a
computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel
formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus,
programs must be written for people to read, and only
incidentally for machines to execute. Second, we believe that
the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this
level is not the syntax of particular programming-language
constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular
functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of
algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the
techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of
large software systems.

    <p>
I was just wondering, a couple of nights ago, at dinner.. "When
did I first decide that I would be doing Engineering?" The answer
â I don't knowâ¦  All I know is that, during my High schooling I
was more interested in Maths and Science {Physics speciallyâ¦}
Then I did what most just-out-of-school kids with an interest in
Math &amp;amp; Science do {specially in that part of the world where I
live, Andhra Pradesh} Took up Math.Phys.Chem in intermediate and
prepare for Engg. entrance tests alongside. After failing to get a
rank that would fetch me an <b>Engg. course</b> in any of the IITs, I
landed here..
</p>

<p>
Then the choice of discipline, that was just based on popular
opinion and luck [called preferential allotmentâ¦] and I finally
ended up in EEE.
</p>

<p>
But the question is when did I make that choice of becoming a
so-called Engineer? Did I ever consider the alternatives and make
a decision? If yes, then when?? What kind of an engineer did I
choose to become? Did I make the choice of becoming an electrical
engineer??
</p>

<p>
I think, I never knew what kind of an Engineer I wanted to be.[
with the knowledge of an average School pass outâ¦, you wouldn't
expect one to know all about the various fields of Engineering.] I
think, I never even exactly knew [and don't do so nowâ¦], what it
means to be an Engineer. An <b>Electrical and Electronics Engineer</b>.
</p>

<p>
But isn't it important that we the future "Engineers" of the
Country, know what it means to be one and what is expected of us?
Isn't that knowledge essential, for taking a decision to do
engineering.. and also to make the most out of the Engineering
programme?
</p>

<p>
I wonder what field {or profession or whatever you call thatâ¦} I
would choose, if I were given a chance nowâ¦ [i.e after a couple
of years in an Engineering Collegeâ¦]â¦ I wonder which
discipline I would choose after getting this little insight into
the various fields in Engineeringâ¦ I wonder what I would choose,
if I get this chance, a couple of years laterâ¦ or five years
laterâ¦ :D
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Engineering is a great profession. There is the fascination of
watching a figment of the imagination emerge through the aid of
science to a plan on paper. Then it moves to realization in stone
or metal or energy. Then it brings homes to men or women. Then it
elevates the standard of living and adds to the comforts of
life. This is the engineer's high privilege. â Herbert Hoover

A few days back.. we [the usual gang of Ringo,9,UC,Vudum n
me.. along with a lot of others who joined us later] were in the
park, just relaxing and having a chatâ¦ but with the others
joining us [with whom I usually don't hang around..] , the topics
discussed were quite different from those that interest meâ¦and
we usually talk on..  I was getting bored.. but suddenly an
interesting idea popped upâ¦ the funda of living on CS.. [though
the tone in which they looked at the idea was differentâ¦ I found
it interesting..]
</p>

<p>
The ppl were criticizing a guy (don't wanna name him :P) {who
hosted wierd maps with soccer and other such stuff in it..}.. the
people were imagining wild things like.. maps in which class-notes
would be read out/scrolledâ¦ maps where food items would be
displayed at lunch time.. etc.. This might look like a funny and
weird idea.. (that gave us all a nice laugh..) but it doesn't seem
ridiculous or crazy to me.. the very fact that the idea was
conceived, annihilates it ridiculousness, for me. Though such a
degree of dependence (and addiction??) may be an over exaggeration
butâ¦
</p>

<p>
A walk in the hostel corridors any time during the night will tell
you why i say thisâ¦ I can see people in every roomâ¦ (literally
every one.. and mind you I am no exception to this..) stuck to
their comps doing all sorts of thingsâ¦ [actually not a wide
range.. its pretty predictableâ¦ :-(] and now after my comp's
network card got burnt out (â¦probablyâ¦ thanks to the lack of
grounding in hostels) I can see it even more clearlyâ¦ that
computers are ruling our livesâ¦ [at this point.. I'm confused
why I started writing thisâ¦ what's it that's bugging me? I'm
definitely not against ppl using Comps.. for I love themâ¦]
</p>

<p>
Is it that it pains me to see people use comps for stuff that's
not so technical? Does it hurt me that we have such "Powerful"
machines before us.. and all we do with them is trivial things
like chat with others or play? I don't think soâ¦ Yes, when I
read the book Hackers:Heroes of the Computer Revolution, I felt
ashamed of using my comp in a meek and powerless wayâ¦ but then I
realise that they were the Hackers from the Hacker land .. and
everyone can't be one, can they? Then what's it, that bugs me?
</p>

<p>
I guess I miss the time we spent in the first (and a little of
second) semesterâ¦ when very few people had comps. We had a great
timeâ¦ doing other activities that were more physicalâ¦ and
refreshing (than sitting in front of a comp and posting
this!!).. I miss those football tourneys we had in the
quadrangles.. I miss those "leg" cricket matchesâ¦ I long for
something like the Wrestling match we [Vudum, Ravi,Thatha n me]
had in my roomâ¦ I miss those thermo sessions with Vudum n
Ravi.. I miss the tuts in Ravi's roomâ¦ (mind you we sometimes
studied even when there weren't exams!!) I guess I miss a lotta
things from the first semâ¦ The time at dinner and the chats in
parks, are the only things that are still intactâ¦ [ I wouldn't
dare forget to mention our recent trip to the woods near the
lakeâ¦ it was awesome!! something that we'll all cherish for
lifeâ¦] I just hope we have more and more and such
momentsâ¦ moments that i will cherish for lifeâ¦ moments.. that
"we" will cherish for lifeâ¦

<b>Update</b>: I just saw Ringo's old cd of Illayaraja songsâ¦ and
 realised, I forgot to mention the wonderful time we
 [Ringo,9,Hari,UC n me..] had listening to them in Ringo's room on
 a CD playerâ¦ and Ringo's mouthorgan!!!

There's a post already with 'exactly' this nameâ¦. by 9â¦ hereâ¦
But this post doesn't have much to do with his postâ¦ [or may be it does??]
</p>

<p>
Here's a Quote on Mahatma Gandhiâ¦
/Generations to come, it may be, will scarcely believe that such a
one, as this, ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. â
Albert Einstein/
</p>

<p>
I was just wonderingâ¦. what would happen if the name Albert
Einstein was replaced by punchaganâ¦ and it turned out
that.. there's a huge huge list of candidates for replacing
Mahatma Gandhiâ¦ [This is with due respect to the Mahatma and
Einstein.. I don't, in any sense, intend to say that the Mahatma
was not a Mahatmaâ¦]
</p>

<p>
All I want to say isâ¦ I am seeing a whole lot of new things, in
people around me, that inspire awe and respect in meâ¦ that every
person is uniqueâ¦ every person is special.. every person can
teach you somethingâ¦. there's something to learn from
everypersonâ¦ that makes me believe God,truly, created man in his
own imageâ¦
</p>

<p>
I am grateful to all the people around me (and those not around
any more..)â¦ who have shown, are showing, and will be showing me
things bright and beautifulâ¦ wise and wonderfulâ¦ which
otherwise I would have failed to see..
</p>

<p>
I am gratefulâ¦ for getting me back on track.. when i go
directionless,.. for setting me examples to emulate,â¦ for being
with me whenever i needed and will need youâ¦
</p>

<p>
[ I would've loved to write down each and every name hereâ¦. but
that's too big a job for this little being to achieveâ¦ ]
</p>


<p>
As William Arthur Ward saysâ¦.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
and not giving it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To All Jaani's of the Worldâ¦ Thanks a Lotâ¦ (I know that's too
small a wordâ¦ but that's all I can give right nowâ¦)

had made, and indeed it was very good."/ Gen 1:27, 31

loyal, through whom you are blessed, and for whom you are
grateful.â  â William Arthur Ward

In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is
then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We
should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner
spirit.  â Albert Schweitzer

A DJ nite's going on here.. for WAVESâ¦. I just went there for a
whileâ¦.  The arrangements were pretty goodâ¦ with Huge huge
huge spks.. [I can still hear the Music quite loud.. sitting here
in my room.. which is quite a distance form the Venueâ¦] There's
real Heart throbbing music [Literallyâ¦ With speakers of over
15000W your heart really throbsâ¦ dub.. dub.. dubâ¦] being
played thereâ¦
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering if we really needed such extravagant
stuffâ¦ I know that such events bring ppl togetherâ¦ but do we
need to spend so much money just to have a have a good dance with
friends?? When a large number of people aren't able to get their
basic neccessities like a Square Meal, Clean drinking water,
proper clothing and shelterâ¦ here we are enjoying a good dance
with friendsâ¦ with elaborately made extravagant
arrangementsâ¦ [of course the money isn't oursâ¦ butâ¦] [ I
know a lot of guys wud've a lot to say against meâ¦. but.. its
ok..]
</p>

<p>
There can't be perfect equality in this worldâ¦ of which duality
is an integral partâ¦. every elementary particle has a dual
natureâ¦ so its but obvious that every thing in this world has a
dual to itâ¦ so its not possible to have a perfect world with
everybody equally placed.. if there is a rich.. then there will be
a poorâ¦ if there is joy.. then there will be despairâ¦ if there
is light.. then there will be darknessâ¦
</p>

<p>
But can't we do anythingâ¦ can't we spread the light to every
place that we possibly could?? Can't we get together to minimize
the difference? Join the race against natureâ¦ do your bitâ¦
</p>

<p>
This, probably, is a good place to start offâ¦
