<blockquote>
<p>
Our design of this introductory computer-science subject
reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the
idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a
computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel
formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus,
programs must be written for people to read, and only
incidentally for machines to execute. Second, we believe that
the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this
level is not the syntax of particular programming-language
constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular
functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of
algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the
techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of
large software systems.

I would like to see a few courses developed on similar lines here.

though. I loved it!

moved to Intrepid from Hardy. (and that too with the campus

I was just wondering, a couple of nights ago, at dinner.. "When
did I first decide that I would be doing Engineering?" The answer
– I don't know…  All I know is that, during my High schooling I
was more interested in Maths and Science {Physics specially…}
Then I did what most just-out-of-school kids with an interest in
Math &amp;amp; Science do {specially in that part of the world where I
live, Andhra Pradesh} Took up Math.Phys.Chem in intermediate and
prepare for Engg. entrance tests alongside. After failing to get a
rank that would fetch me an <b>Engg. course</b> in any of the IITs, I
landed here..
</p>

<p>
Then the choice of discipline, that was just based on popular
opinion and luck [called preferential allotment…] and I finally
ended up in EEE.
</p>

<p>
But the question is when did I make that choice of becoming a
so-called Engineer? Did I ever consider the alternatives and make
a decision? If yes, then when?? What kind of an engineer did I
choose to become? Did I make the choice of becoming an electrical
engineer??
</p>

<p>
I think, I never knew what kind of an Engineer I wanted to be.[
with the knowledge of an average School pass out…, you wouldn't
expect one to know all about the various fields of Engineering.] I
think, I never even exactly knew [and don't do so now…], what it
means to be an Engineer. An <b>Electrical and Electronics Engineer</b>.
</p>

<p>
But isn't it important that we the future "Engineers" of the
Country, know what it means to be one and what is expected of us?
Isn't that knowledge essential, for taking a decision to do
engineering.. and also to make the most out of the Engineering
programme?
</p>

<p>
I wonder what field {or profession or whatever you call that…} I
would choose, if I were given a chance now… [i.e after a couple
of years in an Engineering College…]… I wonder which
discipline I would choose after getting this little insight into
the various fields in Engineering… I wonder what I would choose,
if I get this chance, a couple of years later… or five years
later… :D
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Engineering is a great profession. There is the fascination of
watching a figment of the imagination emerge through the aid of
science to a plan on paper. Then it moves to realization in stone
or metal or energy. Then it brings homes to men or women. Then it
elevates the standard of living and adds to the comforts of
life. This is the engineer's high privilege. – Herbert Hoover

creation of the world. – Albert Einstein

A few days back.. we [the usual gang of Ringo,9,UC,Vudum n
me.. along with a lot of others who joined us later] were in the
park, just relaxing and having a chat… but with the others
joining us [with whom I usually don't hang around..] , the topics
discussed were quite different from those that interest me…and
we usually talk on..  I was getting bored.. but suddenly an
interesting idea popped up… the funda of living on CS.. [though
the tone in which they looked at the idea was different… I found
it interesting..]
</p>

<p>
The ppl were criticizing a guy (don't wanna name him :P) {who
hosted wierd maps with soccer and other such stuff in it..}.. the
people were imagining wild things like.. maps in which class-notes
would be read out/scrolled… maps where food items would be
displayed at lunch time.. etc.. This might look like a funny and
weird idea.. (that gave us all a nice laugh..) but it doesn't seem
ridiculous or crazy to me.. the very fact that the idea was
conceived, annihilates it ridiculousness, for me. Though such a
degree of dependence (and addiction??) may be an over exaggeration
but…
</p>

<p>
A walk in the hostel corridors any time during the night will tell
you why i say this… I can see people in every room… (literally
every one.. and mind you I am no exception to this..) stuck to
their comps doing all sorts of things… [actually not a wide
range.. its pretty predictable… :-(] and now after my comp's
network card got burnt out (…probably… thanks to the lack of
grounding in hostels) I can see it even more clearly… that
computers are ruling our lives… [at this point.. I'm confused
why I started writing this… what's it that's bugging me? I'm
definitely not against ppl using Comps.. for I love them…]
</p>

<p>
Is it that it pains me to see people use comps for stuff that's
not so technical? Does it hurt me that we have such "Powerful"
machines before us.. and all we do with them is trivial things
like chat with others or play? I don't think so… Yes, when I
read the book Hackers:Heroes of the Computer Revolution, I felt
ashamed of using my comp in a meek and powerless way… but then I
realise that they were the Hackers from the Hacker land .. and
everyone can't be one, can they? Then what's it, that bugs me?
</p>

<p>
I guess I miss the time we spent in the first (and a little of
second) semester… when very few people had comps. We had a great
time… doing other activities that were more physical… and
refreshing (than sitting in front of a comp and posting
this!!).. I miss those football tourneys we had in the
quadrangles.. I miss those "leg" cricket matches… I long for
something like the Wrestling match we [Vudum, Ravi,Thatha n me]
had in my room… I miss those thermo sessions with Vudum n
Ravi.. I miss the tuts in Ravi's room… (mind you we sometimes
studied even when there weren't exams!!) I guess I miss a lotta
things from the first sem… The time at dinner and the chats in
parks, are the only things that are still intact… [ I wouldn't
dare forget to mention our recent trip to the woods near the
lake… it was awesome!! something that we'll all cherish for
life…] I just hope we have more and more and such
moments… moments that i will cherish for life… moments.. that
"we" will cherish for life…
</p>

<p>
<b>Update</b>: I just saw Ringo's old cd of Illayaraja songs… and
 realised, I forgot to mention the wonderful time we
 [Ringo,9,Hari,UC n me..] had listening to them in Ringo's room on
 a CD player… and Ringo's mouthorgan!!!

There's a post already with 'exactly' this name…. by 9… here…
But this post doesn't have much to do with his post… [or may be it does??]

<p>
Here's a Quote on Mahatma Gandhi…
/Generations to come, it may be, will scarcely believe that such a
one, as this, ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. –
Albert Einstein/
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering…. what would happen if the name Albert
Einstein was replaced by punchagan… and it turned out
that.. there's a huge huge list of candidates for replacing
Mahatma Gandhi… [This is with due respect to the Mahatma and
Einstein.. I don't, in any sense, intend to say that the Mahatma
was not a Mahatma…]
</p>

<p>
All I want to say is… I am seeing a whole lot of new things, in
people around me, that inspire awe and respect in me… that every
person is unique… every person is special.. every person can
teach you something…. there's something to learn from
everyperson… that makes me believe God,truly, created man in his
own image…
</p>

<p>
I am grateful to all the people around me (and those not around
any more..)… who have shown, are showing, and will be showing me
things bright and beautiful… wise and wonderful… which
otherwise I would have failed to see..
</p>

<p>
I am grateful… for getting me back on track.. when i go
directionless,.. for setting me examples to emulate,… for being
with me whenever i needed and will need you…
</p>

<p>
[ I would've loved to write down each and every name here…. but
that's too big a job for this little being to achieve… ]
</p>


<p>
As William Arthur Ward says….
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
and not giving it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To All Jaani's of the World… Thanks a Lot… (I know that's too
small a word… but that's all I can give right now…)

had made, and indeed it was very good."/ Gen 1:27, 31

loyal, through whom you are blessed, and for whom you are
grateful.”  – William Arthur Ward

In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is
then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We

A DJ nite's going on here.. for WAVES…. I just went there for a
while….  The arrangements were pretty good… with Huge huge
huge spks.. [I can still hear the Music quite loud.. sitting here
in my room.. which is quite a distance form the Venue…] There's
real Heart throbbing music [Literally… With speakers of over
15000W your heart really throbs… dub.. dub.. dub…] being
played there…
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering if we really needed such extravagant
stuff… I know that such events bring ppl together… but do we
need to spend so much money just to have a have a good dance with
friends?? When a large number of people aren't able to get their
basic neccessities like a Square Meal, Clean drinking water,
proper clothing and shelter… here we are enjoying a good dance
with friends… with elaborately made extravagant
arrangements… [of course the money isn't ours… but…] [ I
know a lot of guys wud've a lot to say against me…. but.. its
ok..]
</p>

<p>
There can't be perfect equality in this world… of which duality
is an integral part…. every elementary particle has a dual
nature… so its but obvious that every thing in this world has a
dual to it… so its not possible to have a perfect world with
everybody equally placed.. if there is a rich.. then there will be
a poor… if there is joy.. then there will be despair… if there
is light.. then there will be darkness…
</p>

<p>
But can't we do anything… can't we spread the light to every
place that we possibly could?? Can't we get together to minimize
the difference? Join the race against nature… do your bit…
</p>

<p>
This, probably, is a good place to start off…

We are less than a week away from our supposedly dreaded
'test-1'… n i have no clue even about what the syllabus is, in
each course… There's 'Theory of Relativity', of which i'm able

<p>
Relativity… Emacs…. C++… Python… Table Tennis… learning
a bit of Music… picking up practical electronic

through!!] {I already get the feeling.. its "Another sem down the
drain"}
</p>

<p>
But didn't I begin this sem with plans to "rock" it?? Wasn't I
supposed to attend all the classes that I possible can?? What's it
that I've been doing for the past 5-6 weeks?
</p>

<p>
I don't know!! I really can't pinpoint what's been achieved in the
past one month or so… [other than of course quite a considerable
amount of sleep…….]
</p>

<p>
Why are things so horribly out of place?? What's to be done.. to
get on track asap.. I wonder… What should my priorities be? Why
am I being overwhelmed by the things I got to do?
</p>

<p>
I realise this time of my life is as precious as any
other… (probably more…) and i need to make the most of
it…. but what is that "most"?? [It's definitely not sleep!]
</p>

<p class="verse">
I wish to put together,<br>
all my time, energy and matter<br>
to do a job, little<br>
that will ob'ly be infinitesimal<br>
It wouldn't make me a hero<br>
but shouldn't amount to zero…<br>
<br>
to me, something tangible<br>
definitely seems possible<br>
because nothing is impossible<br>
if there is the quantum of struggle…<br>
<br>
but it must come<br>
before I get back home<br>
needn't create an uproar<br>
but before the end of semsester four<br>
</p>

<p>
[Don't mistake this for a poem… for it is not!! Its just some
scribbling of mine.. which will keep me alive if at the end of
this sem… there's nothing other than this.. which is
tangible… something concrete.. something "see"able]

Little Things.<br>
Little drops of water,<br>

I was at the B.M Birla Science Musuem yesterday… it was calm
with no one in there.. the only people i could see were the
sweepers and cleaners.. the place was dull and lifeless… I dint
like it.. but slowly.. as the afternoon progressed.. people
started coming in and by 5 in the evening.. there were quite a few
in. The museum seemed to have sprung to life suddenly… there was
a lot of action all around with people enjoying in ( and trying to
understand) the wonderful world of science….
</p>

<p>
A lot of kids had come along with their parents… to dive into
the world of science… they were enjoying it… the parents also
turned into kids and were having great fun… it was a great
sight… the parents tried their best to demistify the
happenings… those with a science background did it from thier
knowledge.. the others patiently went through the explanations…
</p>

<p>
The kids were thoroughly enjoying it… I don't know if they would
later on in life remember what they learnt now… but definitely a
love for science and physics will be ignited in their hearts, it
will fill their consciousness… the spirit of curiosity will have
multiplied manifold… even the elders..connected with the child
somewhere deep within themselves… they too enjoyed the wonders
of the world of science…[and ofcourse the company and thrill in
the eyes of their kids..] I too enjoyed the experience… the
experiments and the thrill of the others brought a smile to my
face too…. but it set me thinking…
</p>

<p>
If science can inspire so much awe.. what's happening at our
engineering colleges? When people have the chance to learn a whole
lot of science and put it to practical use… why isn't it that
they are excited about it? Why is it that people just endup
mugging a few formulae just before exams and get over with it?
Where's the problem? Where is that curiosity, all of us had as a
child, lost?
</p>

<p>
I can recollect, in the last sem while doing experiments in the MT
lab there wasn't even a tenth of the awe or joy… that i could
see and feel at the museum… why?? Is it that the child within
us.. [the future engineers] dead? { If that's true.. then the
country is in deep trouble..} But I don't think that's true… I
enjoyed my visit to the museum totally…and I am sure every other
'to be engineer' would have too.. then where's the trouble?
</p>

<p>
I don't know exactly… but I wonder if its because everything is
equated to marks and grades… all that matters to an engineering
student [and the world around him/her..] is his/her CG or
%age… Is this what the country needs? Were the 'temples of
Learning'- the IIT's and a whole lot of other technical
institutions set-up for this very pupose? Of what use are those
engineers to the country, who aren't in awe of science and
engineering, whose spirit of curiosity has been overpowered and
suppressed by the present education system?
</p>

<p>
Isn't it time we have a closer look at our education system… why
are we still sticking to the 'British sytem' introduced during a
colonial rule.. to break the back bone of our nation… to supress
our ability to think rationally.. to produce third rate clerks to
work for them at lower wages? Why is the emphasis on marks and
grades growing exponentially? Shouldn't we start working to cut
this growth at its root? Is this sytem good enough to produce
"real" engineers, doctors, lawyers, journos, CA's, architects,
designers, writers, artists etc etc..
</p>

<p>
Where have all the gurukuls of the ancient past and the
Santiniketans of the recent past gone? Isn't the country in
desparate need of more of these 'temples of learning'??
</p>
