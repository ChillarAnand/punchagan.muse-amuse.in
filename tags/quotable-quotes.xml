&lt;li&gt;In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is
then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We
should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner
spirit.  – &lt;i&gt;Albert Schweitzer, 1875 - 1965&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Anyone who cannot cope with mathematics is not fully human.  At best
he is a tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe and
not make messes in the house.  – &lt;i&gt;Lazarus Long, Time Enough for
Love&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you
could know how seldom they do. – &lt;i&gt;Olin Miller&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you judge people, you have no time to love them. – &lt;i&gt;Mother Teresa&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
and not giving it. – &lt;i&gt;William Arthur Ward&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
Where the mind is without fear and the head held high;&lt;br&gt;
Where knowledge is free;&lt;br&gt;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;&lt;br&gt;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;&lt;br&gt;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;&lt;br&gt;
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;&lt;br&gt;
Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action;&lt;br&gt;
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Rabindranath Tagore – Let My Country Awake&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The true Enlightenment thinker, the true rationalist, never wants to
talk anyone into anything. No, he does not even want to convince;
all the time he is aware that he may be wrong. Above all, he values
the intellectual independence of others too highly to want to
convince them in important matters. He would much rather invite
contradiction, preferably in the form of rational and disciplined
criticism. He seeks not to convince but to arouse — to challenge
others to form free opinions. – &lt;i&gt;Karl Popper – On Freedom&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Don't ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you
come alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is
people who have come alive. – &lt;i&gt;Howard Thurman&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't
hurt. – &lt;i&gt;Charles M Schultz&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Furious activity is no substitute for understanding. –
  &lt;i&gt;H.H. Williams – Activity&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet,
balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take
orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze
a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal,
fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.  –
&lt;i&gt;Robert A. Heinlein – Human Beings&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced — even a proverb is
no proverb to you till your life has illustrated it. – &lt;i&gt;John Keats&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We lie loudest when we lie to ourselves. – &lt;i&gt;Eric Hoffer&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The first hour of the morning is the rudder of the day. – &lt;i&gt;Henry
Ward Beecher&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally
for machines to execute. – &lt;i&gt;Abelson &amp;amp; Sussman – SICP, preface to
the first edition&lt;/i&gt;
