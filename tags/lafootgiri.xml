Well, just another post to make it clear that
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm still alive
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven't forgotten that I have a blog
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven't forgotten my blog's password
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven't lost the ability to write arbit crap.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm not busy with anything interesting
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Keyboard works fine
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Arbit stuff going on around me off-late.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've had our official farewell; So we've officially bid goodbye
to B.I.T.S - Goa. People tried their best to make the occasion
appear "senti" but it seemed more like "psenti" for me.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wonder why our VC calls BITS as B.I.T.S; is it something
similar to people choosing to call SAP as S.A.P?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the advice given was of a copy-book style. But I liked
one of them, though it wasn't expressed well enough for me -
Learning from Books still remains an important way of learning,
even if work teaches you a LOT.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;College now has its own Debian Repository hosted on a server
running Hardy. Hats off to bad\\&lt;sub&gt;sector&lt;/sub&gt; for showing the enthu to
get things done. The LUG here's got a great bunch of people
right now and its growing in leaps and bounds. I'm excited.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of my friends picked up Debian recently and apparently
both of them are loving it thoroughly. Linux, as addictive as
ever.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's been a while since I've been on the winning side in
carroms. Its so boring to be on the losing side for so long.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word is not a document exchange format&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/arbit-blab.html#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ; Use
html, plain text, pdf or the open document format.(if you are
not averse to openness) [I mention this &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; because I faced a
lot of trouble recently trying to handle some .doc files which
replaced the html pages that were being used on the PS site.]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So often, little things get blown out of proportion, so
quickly. Or its just that not everybody sees them as 'little'
things.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On slow connections, the download 'handler' of firefox does
really poorly. It's next to impossible to download anything over
half an MB.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This from the preface of SICP&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/arbit-blab.html#fn.2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ,a text book for an
introductory course on Computer Programming at MIT
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our design of this introductory computer-science subject
reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the
idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a
computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel
formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus,
programs must be written for people to read, and only
incidentally for machines to execute. Second, we believe that
the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this
level is not the syntax of particular programming-language
constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular
functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of
algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the
techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of
large software systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would like to see a few courses developed on similar lines here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gmail themes are good. I only tried the "Terminal" theme,
though. I loved it!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the very first time, I upgraded a distro. I successfully
moved to Intrepid from Hardy. (and that too with the campus
net!) This was before the repositories had been set-up. Now, it
should be a much simpler job to achieve the same
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just got the news of more Violence in Mumbai; What the hell do
these people want? I end this post here.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's an xkcd strip I liked.

Summer'08! I'm at home, doing nothing practically. :| No
Internships, No Projects, No GRE plans (a little pushing for GRE
has just started from the junta around.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Just to kill some time and to learn some Python, I have begun to
write an IRC chat bot &amp;amp;lt;lafoobot&amp;amp;gt; [Lafoot + Bot]. The present
haven of lafoobot is #fosskelog @ irc.freenode.net. Join in, if
you want to have a chat! ;) Lafoobot can presently do very few
things
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Yoyo", a newly joined user
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Hello"/ "Yoyo", a user or pass on a Hello/Yoyo from user to
another.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives Local time / GMT
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives a random word and its meaning [put in for the junta
preparing for GRE ;)]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives out an MOTD or a fortune when it first joins \\#fosskelog
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Googles a search term and returns the top 5 results (This is my
favourite feature and this is the reason partially for this
post. "!google lafoobot" doesn't return anything. Hopefully not
anymore.)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you have ideas for any other features or if you want to have a
look at the source, comment here or join #fosskelog. lafoobot's
code is licensed under GPLv2!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Other than this, the summer has been relatively uneventful but for
the two FOSS events I attended. Yes, two events, Sat and Sun, both
by Twincling (There are two different Twinclings! Don't ask me
why) Hoping to have some more action this summer!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
PS: There's a Big discussion presently on whether lafoobot is a he
or a she. ;) What do you think?
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>IRC</category><category>lafootgiri</category><category>ology</category><category>python</category><guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/lafoot-or-lafoobot.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2008 11:09:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Home Coming!</title><link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/home-coming.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I'll be on board the Amaravathi Express in less than three hours
from now! Bags packed, I'm waiting for the sun to rise, the World
to wake up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have set my self an objective of completing 40 problems from
Project Euler. I have done 39. [With exams going on I consider it
good progress] I will be attempting to push off the last one
before leaving. Here I come, Project Euler. Here I come,
Hyderabad!
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blab</category><category>lafootgiri</category><category>python</category><guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/home-coming.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2008 18:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Not so Floppix...</title><link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/not-so-floppix.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Disambiguation:&lt;/b&gt; The original Linux on 2 Floppies is here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I, post this from a remastered version of Knoppix that we named
Floppix!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It all actually began, with me deciding to do a bit of Emacs-ing
at home during the winter hols but I don't have a Linux box at
home. Live-CD is the way to go! But then Emacs doesn't \\*usually\\*
go with Live-CDs. So I decided to get around making my own. :)
[Dunnet "Dunnet Game"),
an Adventure game in Emacs, played a crucial role in motivating me
to go ahead!] The rest as they say is historyâ€¦.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Actually, I tried a debootstrap from my Debian etch but I couldn't
manage to get the initrd working. [[&lt;a href="http://avudem.blogspot.com"&gt;http://avudem.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;
"Voodoo"][I ain't this geekish, its only that I am incapable of
putting these terms in a simpler language.] After numerous futile
attempt, I gave up for the time being and that's when the genius
of [Voodoo]] came in, he took a different route. Remastering
Knoppix.[Modifying an existing Live-CD of Knoppix]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I won't get into the exact details of how we got about it. There's
a lot of online help available for that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A few highlights, for the curious readerâ€¦
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got rid of the default KDE and replaced it with
Fluxbox. [actually Floppix = Fluxbox + Knoppix :P]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added emacs, cmucl, slime, octave, linuxdcpp, vlc and others.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;got rid of other packages which we weren't going to use.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changed the boot message
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changed the default background image.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;removed the default boot image [ couldn't change it as the image
we chose wasn't being properly converted to lss16 format ]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tested the CD with Qemu [size of the iso got more than 700MB]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;removed a few other not so regularly used packages [including
wine!]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;burnt the CD
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logged in!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, that I've logged in, I realize we managed to quite a decent
job. Obviously we weren't perfect. It was the first time and done
in quite a hurry. [btw, we have our end-sems going on; I've no
exam tomorrow though] I was able to listen to music, connect to
the DC, play a game of dunnet and make a blogpost! We also missed
a few packages, for instance a screen shot capture program! But it
ain't too bad, still a long way to go though!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Just hoping we manage to make it better, as we get better at it!
;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here comes FloppixV0.1!
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Update [3/1/08]: I never knew that GIMP could capture screenshots!
ImageMagick can do that too. I had two programs at hand and
thought I had none! Here's a Screenshot of the Floppix Desktop.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Picture Source [for the Background Image] : 9
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Update 2 [4/1/08]: There is already a floppy distro of Linux
called Floppix. I knew about this only when some one searching for
it reached my blog. Guess I should do something about this. [I'll
be able to do it only after getting back to campus,though]

Another post, with nothing concrete to sayâ€¦
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are just a few random musings, for those curious about my
life and for the good health of my Blog which is so close to its
death..
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;College (+ Hostel) is amongst few places, that everyone on
Earth(&amp;amp; elsewhere) \\*must\\* get the chance to be in. There's a
whole new world out here, with hell a lotuva things you can do,
Here and Only Hereâ€¦ [I am not, by any means, talking of
acads!]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects. Yes they are a part of almost all my random
stuffâ€¦ cos I just Love them, when they are self-assigned and
off-hand. They get even more exciting, when the learning curve
is Steep!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlines can be wonderful things, if only I learn to respect
them.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lab-Tests, i guess, are amongst the most hyped tests in the
World! They aren't worth all that fuss.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grades ain't everything in Life. Not even if you are doing
Engineering!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I live amidst /wonderful* singers, &lt;b&gt;marvelous&lt;/b&gt; music composers,
&lt;b&gt;facile&lt;/b&gt; lyric writers, &lt;b&gt;cool&lt;/b&gt; Hackers, &lt;b&gt;amazing&lt;/b&gt; photographers,
&lt;b&gt;inspiring&lt;/b&gt; poets and what not. [Why the hell do people then,
look just for the *"industrious"/ grade scorers?]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music and Sleep are Great Healers. Laughter, too, is a close
competitor.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU/Linux is addictive. More n more people getting addicted,
everyday!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RHCE's got a pretty interesting test. Its rare to be interested
in undergoing the torture of a test, ain't it?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rules seem to be total crap, until you get the chance to look at
them from above.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quark'08 coming up! Gottu gear up for it!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprees?? They don't bother me so much any more.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, for those who found all the above stuff boring and
dumbâ€¦ here's some food for thought &amp;gt; The Best things in Life
aren't Thingsâ€¦
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/images/bestthingsinlife.jpg" alt="bestthingsinlife.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>blab</category><category>exams</category><category>lafootgiri</category><category>quark</category><guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/life-in-gen.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2007 12:07:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Lost Control??</title><link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/lost-control.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Caution&lt;/b&gt;: This post is just some arbit crap, that arose from some
 internal probing. Its utterly worthless for any reader other than
 myself. This could possibly even be classified narcissistic or
 whatever that's called.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Presently, I've got tests going on and they are half way
through. Considering this and the fact that its been over a month
since I last posted, writing a post now doesn't make much sense,
does it?[If my blog's been dormant so long, can't it be so for a
couple of days more?] But things I've been up to off-late, don't
make much sense. [in the past, at least they made sense to me if
not to others.] This post is just about that, going from being
senseless to at least being less sense [and hopefully, to being
sensible]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've screwed up the tests so far, and don't think will be doing
much better in the others too. Even otherwise, I haven't done
anything good, anything that feels great, anything that feels
right, in the past couple of months (years?? decades??) [except
for one video with 'the gang', i didn't contribute much
though]. Let alone accomplishing something nice, I haven't even
been attempting anything decent enough. My priorities have gone
haywire, or may be not, may be I'm just doing things that are very
low on the scale or may be I'm not doing anything, things are just
hapenning.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've slept through 'n' classes both inside and outside the
classroom
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've stayed awake all night downloading some crap for my comp.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had been worrying about keeping my blog alive. Made numerous
attempts to post something, even if its no big deal not posting
regularly.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed 4 different OSes in a couple of days!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;been ages since I last visited the Library.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slept through the morning lotsa times, even if I enjoy EBER-ing
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bunked bathing just because i'll have more clothes to wash!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The list is pretty long. It ain't sensible to be putting down the
whole thing here.&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; I guess I've just been trying to escape
things. Running from doing important stuff. I've had enough. Its
high time I do something about it. I've decided to get in control
of my life, rather than being controlled by arbit stuff like
sleep, a blog, a grade, an addiction, a song, a cricket match, a
rain, a meal, a game of carrom, a prof's accent, a course, a test
or other such trivialities.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wish to get back on track!!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
..to get back into the habit of doing things I love, at the time
and place I like.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
..to doing things that give me joy, in the true sense. Not
momentary, passing pleasures.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hopefully, with some effort, I will. (A nudge is all it takes.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
btw, if this post was a total bouncer, this is for youâ€¦.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi! I'm a bit lateâ€¦(courtesy:lightning quick network speeds
@collâ€¦{I started this post a couple of weeks back, at
homeâ€¦ and its been rotting all this while, in my drafts!} ) [Its
already time when the resolutions taken just a couple of weeks
back fade away into oblivionâ€¦ ] but anyways.. Wish You a Very
Happy gNew Year!! oops.. Happy New Year!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Actually this year started of for me not as the usual Happy New
Year.. but as Happy gNew Year! I have been gifted a new PC by my
mom n dad for the new yearâ€¦ and that too an AMD system, (Believe
it or Not..) preloaded with Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4]!
{Its like a fairy tale for meâ€¦} Its an AMD Athlon 3200+ with
(512+256)MB RAM and 80GBHDDâ€¦. and an awesome 17" TFT Monitor!!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am happy that my resolutions to have a go at the compâ€¦ [ and
use it to the best of my abilities to learn about s/w and
h/wâ€¦. to try n imbibe in myself the spirit of true hackingâ€¦]
haven't yet gone down the drain! { I've already ripped open the
HCL company seal on my boxâ€¦ and opened it up a couple of times
to fiddle with my HDD and RAMâ€¦ }
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A couple of days after I got the compâ€¦ I tried installing
Debianâ€¦ and being a NooB doesn't help..(does it?).. I messed up
the X-Serverâ€¦  After some desperate attempts to get the thing
working.. I gave upâ€¦â€¦. [I had some ebooks etc. downloaded on
my comp at home, which I wished to dump on my comp]. So I
persistedâ€¦ I tried FC 6 [Fedora Core] â€¦. everything was fine
until the final stepâ€¦ FC refused to show me the Login screen!!
Finally at 3 am I gave upâ€¦. I planned to get the most valuable
stuff onto a CD and set things right, back in the comforts of my
room and the company of Voodoo, but that was not to beâ€¦.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At 10am, (I just woke up then), I find that the comp at home
refuses to turn ON!! I thought it was some petty problem like a
loose contact somewhere, which could be set right easily.. but
after an hour of struggle.. I realise that the problem is
serious.. {The SMPS had blown off} [looks like a Hindi
Movie,doesn't it??]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then began the real fun!! I somehow managed to connect the old
hard disk to the new Mother Boardâ€¦[my new cabinet is quite
smallâ€¦ I now realize that I placed the HDD in quite a precarious
positionâ€¦].. but there was no OS on either HDDâ€¦ [the "Windows"
on the old oneâ€¦. din't openâ€¦ they felt awkward in their new
environsâ€¦ ;-) ] I would have returned back to coll without any
of my stuff.. but for Knoppix (live) â€¦ it saved the day for me!!
Finally I managed to dump my stuff onto the new HDDâ€¦ [All 's
well that ends well!! :-)] Now I've got both the Linux distro's
[Debian and FC-6] along with all the stuff I collected at home! [
Thanks to V00d00!! ] along with a little confidence that I am not
too bad at handling H/W!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I look back at this whole episodeâ€¦ It feels as if nature
had conspiredâ€¦. to keep this one resolution of mine ALIVEâ€¦. to
ignite in me the fire of "the spirit of true hacking"â€¦ [ I hope
that I play my part well.. (nature played its brilliantlyâ€¦) and
pick up a zillionth part of the commitment ( and dedication to
hacking) of the Hackers from the Hacker Land!! ]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's a pic of one of the very few cool things I could get my
comp to doâ€¦.. [ I accessed the Remote Desktop Server on my own
systemâ€¦..]
&lt;/p&gt;

Just finished the 'Test-2'. Here's the first
post that can genuinely be called "mine"â€¦
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With my last minute 'C2S' plans [Co-operate to Surviveâ€¦ does it
ring any bells??] failing to work, the tests did their job,cleaned
me up [both literally and metaphorically]. Though I didn't learn
much while preparing for the tests, the syllabus gave me a brain
wave (surprised to find that my Brain is still tickingâ€¦. after
more than one year of Engg.) : Build my first Computer game!!
[Don't expect too much from itâ€¦ I'm a novice at programming and
my game doesn't even have a GUI as of now!]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had been doing a l'l bit of C programming off late but, I never
learnt 'file management' until the "Test-2" forced me to, and
Viola! I embarked on a self assigned, "Project - Hangman".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's a peek at the gameâ€¦ [after a lot of
testing and debugging (the use of technical terms is just a matter
of "phantee")]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"Phantee"- a typical hyderabadi term; has no literal english
translation; refers to "concealing ignorance in style" ??
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The basics were quite simple and were done in
two hoursâ€¦ but then began the real test! The program needed a
lot of improvements to make it "Playable" but, the tests were less
than a week away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I managed to find enough time even during the
tests (it doesn't really matter whether you spend a week, a day or
just an hour mugging - you are bound to be cleaned up!), and
finished most of the stuff within a week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There were quite a few road blocks which I had to get
around. Amongst other things, obtaining a 'decent' database of
words was one. Initially, I wrote another program for building up
a dbase of your own. This wasn't good enoughâ€¦. so, with some
ideas from Arunodai, I successfully integrated a dbase of 14000
words [picked it from another version of hangman] with my own
version. After one whole week of debugging and improving {with an
annoying disturbance called 'Test-2'}, now my game is quite
'playable' (i.e it can be played by people other than me).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So you might say, "what's the big-deal about writing a simple
program of about hundred lines, that can randomly display words
and check if you guess it right within seven turns?". This l'll
project of mine may seem like a Pro'jest' to many! [writing a
complex code, messing it up, debugging it for one whole week, etc
just for the sake of creating a simple game, that can be played if
you have a friend,a pen and a paper. Doing so much&amp;lt;span
class="text"&amp;gt; for a game, that already has 'n' version,
seems very foolish and a collosal waste
of time and effort. Doesn't it??] Obviously, that's not a great
achievement, its not something thats worth a mention in the
Guiness Book of World Records or something. But it taught me a lot
of stuff, stuff that you can't learn from books,stuff that you
can't learn by mugging [I wonder if you can learn anything under
the sun by "Mugging"], stuff that you can only learn by
experience.I learnt a lot more of Computer Programming through
this project, than I learnt through two, '3-point' courses!! {Of
course, I wouldn't have even dreamt of doing such a thing, if not
for these two courses, that introduced me to programming and
taught me the essentials}. Can't such projects make the other
courses a joy too?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This brings me to our recent TRW [Technical Report Writing]
project. You might wonder what kind of projects could be given in
this kind of a course. We were asked to write a report on 'Waste
Management' in our college, and to include some suggestions on the
ways to improve it. Though this was an interesting job, with scope
for some field activity and other such stuff, we [a group of six
members] successfully turned the 'project' into a Pro'jest'!!
[that's my personal view; the others in the group may
disagree].But still, we learnt a lot on Report writing. A lot more
than what we learnt by reading pages and pages of instructions, on
the techniques of writing good reports,by the so called experts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Both the projects helped me understand stuff better and to put
them to use. Why can't all courses have little projects, along
with the routine stuff? Will it not improve my understanding of
the subject matter? Will I not learn a great deal of things more
than I do by mugging things up, just a week before the tests? Will
it not be an experience, a lesson, of its own??
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I see and I forget.
I hear and I remember.
I do and I understand.
â€“A Chinese Proverb.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wonder if my "Engineering", will ever be a joy for me?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am looking forward to more Projectsâ€¦ to make engineering a joy
for me!! [it doesn't matter even if they're self-assigned ;-) ]
