If you aren't already aware of it, I'm one of those people who
goes around saying, "GitHub is my Facebook".  I spend quite a lot
of time on GitHub, browsing the work of various people, looking at
loads of interesting stuff that people built.  I keep jumping
between people pages and projects using the Watchers/Watching &amp;amp;
Followers/Following pages.  This way, I do come across interesting
people and projects, but the SNR is too low.  I wanted a better
way to be able to see stuff, that I find interesting.  That's how
the idea for this Chromium app – GitHub Cue – was born.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
@baali and I hacked on this, during the last few days and got it
working.  It works as follows, (from the README) —
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrapes all the descriptions of the repositories being watched
by the user.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key terms are extracted from this description text using the
Yahoo Term Extractor.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A list of languages is obtained, based on the languages of the
repositories, the user if watching.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub searches are performed for a combination of 3 randomly
chosen languages and 5 random key terms.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 random repositories out of all these, are shown.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
This is a very simplistic algorithm, but works decently for my
purposes.  Ideally, I would've liked to use a Collaborative
Filtering algorithm, but I found the data to be too sparse, and
the amount of computation to be too much to be done on the fly.  I
wasn't really interested in pre-computing stuff and putting it
onto my server.  I settled down to the next best thing I could
think of.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I would appreciate any further ideas and suggestions.  Thanks!

Over the last two days, I hacked up my first Chrome extension.
I've been using Chrome only for the past couple of weeks or so and
I begin to like it, though some of the extensions aren't as mature
as I would've liked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The original idea was floated by my friend,  Madhu, and Lee helped
me quite a bit, while I was working on it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;What does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is a simple extension, that shows pop-ups, whenever there is
an update in your GitHub "Wall" (yes, this is a Facebook world)
or News Feed as they call it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After installation, you will need to save your &lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;token&lt;/code&gt; for the extension to work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;Where to get it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Presently, you will need to get it from GitHub.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I might add it to the Chrome Web Store, once I see more people
using it.  I couldn't justify, to myself, paying the initial
one-time verification fee that Google asks for.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;UPDATE&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;span class="timestamp-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;[2011-03-04 Fri]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Added GetHub to the store
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;Comments and Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel free to write to me at &lt;code&gt;punchagan+gethub@jeemail.com&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or file issues at GitHub.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Happy GitHubbing!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
