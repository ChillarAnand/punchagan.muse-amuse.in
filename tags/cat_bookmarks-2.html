<p>
Here's my advice for Lucy:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Stay wildly ambitious. The current world is bubbling with
opportunity for an ambitious person to find flowery, fulfilling
success. The specific direction may be unclear, but it'll work
itself out – just dive in somewhere.
</li>

<li>Stop thinking that you're special. The fact is, right now, you're
not special. You're another completely inexperienced young person
who doesn't have all that much to offer yet. You can become
special by working really hard for a long time.
</li>

<li>Ignore everyone else. Other people's grass seeming greener is no
new concept, but in today's image crafting world, other people's
grass looks like a glorious meadow. The truth is that everyone
else is just as indecisive, self-doubting, and frustrated as you
are, and if you just do your thing, you'll never have any reason
to envy others.

The irony is this is actually what ancient philosophy was intended
to ameliorate. “Vain is the word of a philosopher,” Epicurus once
said, “which does not heal the suffering of man.” Centuries later,
Thoreau expressed this same thought: “To be a philosopher is not
merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school . . . it
is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically,
but practically.”

think that chest-high layouts or 10-foot grabs in wolf packs are
hallmarks of the elite game. But I beg to differ. It’s true,
sometimes incredible feats of athleticism are the only way to save a
possession or get a block—and they aren’t easy to execute. Still,
it’s the most mundane things that often make the biggest impacts on
the field.

There is a time and a place for reflection and contemplation about
the greater universe. Now, I know I sound like a hypocrite because I
do write about these things a lot, but I’ll tell you now, as someone
who does over-think it, sometimes you just have to let it be what it
is and not become overwhelmed by the vastness, mysteriousness and
unknown possibility that lies around us. It can be more debilitating
than inspiring sometimes.

"Sachin saw Hemant and asked in Marathi 'Me zaaoo ka?' ('Can I go')?
Before Hemant could nod his head, Sachin was already in the field as
a substitute for Pakistan. It was towards the end of the match and
Sachin was on the field for about 25 minutes."

<p>
Deep down, many of us wonder if we’re wasting our time on things of
little consequence. So we keep skittering along the surface at a
feverish pace, avoiding the mirror of introspection.
</p>

<p>
I’ve found recently that when the time is used well, slowness can
actually be one of the most profound sources of abundance.
</p>

<p>
And on the positive side, sometimes entrepreneurs work on their
businesses after hours out of love, rather than straining toward an
overly-optimistic deadline out of fear. I’ve been there, I’ve put in
the hours and I’ll do it again. But not unless I’m motivated by
love.

<p>
I’ve encountered a few misconceptions about what Hacker School is
and who it’s for. I’m not an official source of information; for
that, I recommend the User’s Manual and this blog post. Having said
that, here are a few things I’ve heard people say that attest to
misconceptions about Hacker School, and my responses to them.

<p>
From Angelo’s blog: “I remember the exact moment…Jen’s voice and the
numb feeling that enveloped me. That feeling has never left. I’ll
also never forget how we looked into each other’s eyes and held each
other’s hands. ‘We are together, we’ll be ok.’”
</p>

<p>
Throughout her battle, Angelo decided to photograph it. He wanted to
humanize  the face of cancer on the face of his wife. The photos
speak for themselves.

It takes 10,000 hours to become an “expert in an ultra competitive

actually takes 20 hours. The equivalent of 45 minutes a day for a

it is not every day that you get to play against someone with 13000
Test runs. It is not every day that you get to play against someone

If you have legacy code in MATLAB, then it may make sense to just
continue using it. If it works, don’t fix it. However, if your
Matlab code keeps causing you pain, Python might be a solution.

<p>
We're one month into the second year of Catalyst, an after-school
tech/computer class that I run for kids aged 9-13, and this year
I've decided to try something different. [Last year, I had the kids
learn in a browser-based / console-like IDE that I created - kind of
like CodeAcademy, but ultimately it was just too much work to
maintain and too limiting]. My new plan is to teach the kids how to
build their own interactive websites from scratch using HTML, CSS
and Javascript, and to do it on their own Linux VPS (CentOS 6) using
Vim. I know it probably sounds crazy, but if the preliminary
reception and results are any indication, I think it's going to be a
success.

<p>
Here is a fun bucket list of the places you simply have to visit
before you turn thirty. They are not just destinations but also
crazy experiences that will go down the book of your memory
lane. From treading on Living Root Bridges in Cherrapunji to a bike
ride through Ladakh, trekking through the valley of flowers in
Himalayas to surfing in Orissa, here are some insane experiences.
