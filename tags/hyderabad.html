        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
Well, I'm not sure if it's worth writing about.  I conducted my
first org-mode workshop along with Prof. Venkatesh Choppella at
IIIT-Hyderabad.  It was a 3 hour demo+talk kind of a thing, with a
small audience of about 20 people, most of whom were new to
Emacs.
</p>

<p>
We covered almost all the aspects of Org-mode after giving a brief
introduction to Emacs.  Outlining and note-taking part was simple
and easy to understand, but the audience couldn't really
appreciate the part of keeping TODO lists and agendas and other
stuff.  I'm hoping, the reason was not me taking over from
Venkatesh.
</p>

<p>
I think the workshop should've been more hands-on and we should've
asked people to try out stuff on the spot, instead of showing off
the things possible with Emacs.  They probably would've
appreciated a few things better, that way.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, we will be doing more workshops on Org-mode and there
are surely somethings to take away from this one.  I hope at least
one of the participants, gets hooked to Org-mode.
</p>

<p>
The talk outline is here.

        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
I hadn't been much in the City for the past three years. I've had
a little trouble recollecting the exact routes and corresponding
bus numbers. I Googled for it, with little hope, and the results
didn't surprise me. There wasn't much info in this regard. On the
occasion of World Environment, when the focus is on promoting the
use of Public Transport, this isn't a very encouraging sign.
</p>

<p>
I was wondering if the Bus route info can somehow be integrated
with Google maps or the like. This will be a good thing to do,
since people who have access to internet (the higher rungs of the
society) are the ones who are most aware of the threats to the
Environment and also the ones who least use public transport. This
could help them do some planning and encourage use of public
transport. Later on, may be the Buses could have some kind of a
GPS sytem that could be interlinked with the maps, giving people
great power! I'm not sure if this already exists elsewhere in the
world, but seemed an interesting thing to do.
</p>

<p>
On a different note, just wanted to share this different
perspective my mom was giving to my 7 year old neice. We were on a
bus and my niece wasn't very happy about the crowd and the Bus
journey. My mom, then said something, probably to amuse the kid
and distract her for a while. But its an interesting way of
looking at things.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You should be proud that you are aboard a bus that costs around 15
lacs, something we wouldn't normally be able to buy. And that too
for a small sum of Rs. 5. You are being driven around by a
chauffeur employed by the State Govt. and you needn't bother
yourself with the routes and other headaches of driving you'd have
if you used your personal carâ€¦
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The kid wasn't convinced or even amused by this, but I liked the
interesting observation. Some food for thought, My mom travels for
an hour and half by bus to reach her work and she's been doing so
since I was a kid of 5 or 6. Now I know why she's been able to do
it for so many years, everyday!

Phew! I'm back home after one of my worst semesters so far. [there
have been only 4 upto now!! :P] {Also, not one of the better ones
grades-wise, but otherwise?? anyways.. forget it.. } From today
on, the lives of 2,27,483 young boys and girls [with the exception
of a few thousands] (in that part of the World called Andhra
Pradesh) will never be the same again. The so called verdict on
their lives (yes, the verdict of their lives!!) has been
pronounced at 11:45am today. EAMCET-07 [Engineering, Agriculture
and Medicine Common Entrance Test] results announced. This is no
more a matter of anxious students checking out, how they fared in
comparison to others of their age. It's no more a matter of
getting into Under-grad to come out a Grad in a chosen discipline.
</p>

<p>
"The Hottest Topic" in town. Nobody's left out of it. Young or
Old, Rich or Poor, Stout or Slim, Tall or Short, Theist or
Atheist, Engineers or Doctors, Black or White. "Black or White"??
How could I and those around me be left out?
</p>

<p>
Here's a little from what i seeâ€¦ [Is a little exaggeration
allowed?]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An ad on the FMâ€¦ "ee karyakramanni
samarpinchindiâ€¦ engineering vijethala mata.. bata.. Sri
chaitanya.." [This programme is brought to you byâ€¦ Sri
Chaitanya.. the voice and choice of Engineering Winners!!]
</li>
<li>Another ad. Neti EAMCET phalitalalo kooda atyuttamaina vijayala
thoâ€¦ Narayana.. [With the most wonderful victories even in
this time's EAMCET, Narayana] {Sri Chaitanya and Narayana are
two very popular Junior Colleges here.. with hazaar
franchises.. all over the State}
</li>
<li>A : How did your neighbor's cousin's friend's daughter's friend
do? [ob exaggerated] B : She didn't do quite well. It seems she
didn't study the I yr syllabus properly!! {How did he ever get
to know that?!!?!?}
</li>
<li>Me : Where's A? Why's he so late? J.H : His sister's Medicine
results are out. She scored 700! A local rank of 10! She'll get
into any place she chooses. Me : That's cool. So that guys gone
for a party or what? J.H : No he's consoling his sister! She's
weeping for she expect to score a rank close to 300! Me : Oh
c'mon!!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why the hell is the whole state dragged into this? Can't the guys
n gals be left alone? Why is that a little thing as a test that
allocates various grad seats to the students, blown out of
proportion? Do we need big Corporate giants fighting for the ranks
and cash of aspiring students? Why all the hue and cry??
</p>

<p>
Isn't is possible for these people to have a normal life, where
these CET's are just a part of their lives and not their LIVES
themselves? Can't they be doing other things along with preparing
to get into a good grad school? Do we wish to have Engineers and
Doctors who, all through the best couple of years of their lives,
were busy grinding, swallowing and puking out heaps and heaps of
books just to get one seat in a Grad School?
</p>

<p>
Will things ever be normal again? When will kids "here" start
being kids? When will the parents and teachers and all the zillion
others understand that their kids need to be given everything in
life, exposed to everything. Not just dumping in gallons of
formulae and tons of equations. Will people ever give CETs just
that much attention as it deserves, and not make it a big issue
all over the state? When will the EAMCET stop being the lives of
college students and start being just a part of their lives??
</p>

<p>
[I have tried my best to portray the situation, in this part of
the World. But it is quite possible that I didn't do it well
enoughâ€¦.]
