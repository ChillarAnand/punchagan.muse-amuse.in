The ripples on the quiet lake,<br>
twinkling stars on a moonless night,<br>
and his lonely, crazy, thoughts,<br>
yet again, his faithful companions<br>
on another of those countless nights,<br>
searching for meaning, awaiting the dawn.<br>
<br>
the night crawled by, as he drifted afloat,<br>
memories of the past and dreams of the future,<br>
until approaching footsteps, brought him back<br>
did the chill of the wind, get to his head?<br>
or was his guarded secret, not his anymore?<br>
<br>
Before his thoughts, collect, he could,<br>
his friend, from far away lands unknown,<br>
was there with him, to share his thoughts,<br>
to hear the wind hum the tunes of yore,<br>
while the stars and the lake, as a duo, danced.<br>
<br>
They watch the sun rise, from atop the hillock,<br>
basking in the warmth, and see the town wake up,<br>
lose themselves in the woods below,<br>
on their way back, rest by the lake shore,<br>
watching it, silently, shine in the daylight,<br>
letting it wet their feet and clear his head.<br>
<br>
Together, they cook themselves, a delicious meal,<br>
n enjoy it, with some of the choicest old wine.<br>
Catch-up on things, and yearn for more, discuss<br>
all the many things, under the sun, and over,<br>
without a clue, as to how much time flew by.<br>
<br>
Riding away, as fast as they could, they reach,<br>
just in time, as the sun set, over the seas,<br>
perched on bicycles, in mirrored positions, with<br>
resonating thoughts, the horizon, they watch<br>
the sun set, the beach light up, and the fair begin.<br>
<br>
They ate and drank, sung and danced and<br>
just had a good time, for the rest of the night,<br>
indulging, in all that the fair could offer.<br>
the night was long, but if wouldn't go on forever,<br>
pretty well, they knew, they day was to end.<br>
<br>
the twinkling stars they watched, yet again,<br>
but to the sea's song, on the still warm sand<br>
slowly, but steadily, into sleep he drifted,<br>
only to be awake, moments later, with the<br>
bright sun coming harshly down upon him,<br>
lighting up the lake, like a carpet of jewels.<br>
<br>
all he had, once again, were just his thoughts,<br>
the lake, and not the sea, by his side,<br>
with fading impressions of an impossible dream<br>
after all, wasn't it just too much action,<br>
for just one day, for a life engulfed by ennui?<br>
<br>
One some day, he told himself, and walked away.<br>

the time, together spent,<br>
the memories cherished,<br>
all the love, concern and care<br>
may they stay with us, for life.<br>
<br>
as high and far as you like<br>
may you fly, like you own the sky<br>
while I fumble, with my flying guide<br>
I see the world, through your eyes<br>
<br>
may you run, with all your might<br>
as if, fighting for life, you are.<br>
struggling to walk, I stumble and fall,<br>
but get up each time, inspired to run.<br>
<br>
may you, in all that we shared<br>
find strength to go on, if en-route<br>
our paths diverged; you may have to wait,<br>
but you shall see me, on the other side!<br>

Thanks to Chaitu, I re-read Love Unvoiced a few times and
realized, I was trying to say too much. Here's another poem,
with one part of what I wanted to say. I will not be writing
newer poems, to say the other stuff. Perform your own Fourier
analysis.

Hard, I tried, to stay mum,<br>
and keep it all within.<br>
But, not much longer can I stand,<br>
I give in, and here's my song<br>
<br>
wherever you are, anywhere you go,<br>
whatever you do, or choose not to,<br>
whatever you think and however you feel,<br>
my love for you, it shall only grow.<br>
<br>
Sweet, is the attachment,<br>
but let it not keep you from flying.<br>
the clear open sky, it's all yours<br>
fly! fly! fly!<br>
<br>
see all that you want to,<br>
and do all that you'd like to.<br>
to your hearts content, fly!<br>
without a care in the world, fly!<br>
<br>
for, if ever, you wish to rest,<br>
now you know, where to return<br>
right here, I shall be,<br>
with love, just a little more.<br>
<br>
Mute, I chose to be, but, boy!<br>
does it need to be told. All over me,<br>
it's written; and you, sure, read me!<br>
Love you, for being the more loving one!<br>

Come spring -<br>
a fresh lease of green<br>
drapes the bare branches.<br>
<br>
The leaves, dancing and whistling<br>
to the tunes of the wind<br>
playing, screaming, and singing,<br>
in each other's company, enjoying.<br>
<br>
Singing to one another<br>
promises of sticking together,<br>
come what may, through it all.<br>
<br>
The song goes on,<br>
but the count goes down,<br>
not noticed or just unacknowledged,<br>
first by one and then by many more.<br>
<br>
the song, still, goes on.<br>
And the promises too, of course.<br>
The song goes on and on and on.<br>
<br>
Until silence falls upon, when all<br>
of them are gone. The tree, knowing well,<br>
watches on - it won't be long before<br>
a new bunch springs up to sing the song.<br>

Achieve something, I'm often reminded,<br>
achieve something, something that's worthwhile.<br>
Don't just kill time, they say,<br>
for, brutally, it shall kill you someday.<br>
<br>
Make the best use of time, I tell myself,<br>
for I realize, how I spend my days<br>
is how I'm spending my life and<br>
I'm going to get just one of it!<br>
<br>
But, what is worthwhile, I wonder<br>
everything seems so good one moment<br>
and all meaning vanishes the very next.<br>
I'm utterly confused, somebody help!<br>
<br>
Pick one from, spoke my brother,<br>
the 'everything' that seems good<br>
and do it right, just, do it right!<br>
Life, as you live through it, shall<br>
teach you to do things that are right<br>
and at the end of it all, you'll<br>
never regret what you've done<br>
but, only what you couldn't!<br>

This is a free world,<br>
you are free to will and whim,<br>
can it, at the cost of,<br>
your brother n his freedom,be?<br>
<br>
Life is price'less',<br>
the big shots say, we realize.<br>
is it why, you sell ya brethren's life,<br>
cheaply, for personal gain?<br>
<br>
The human'kind', we call ourselves,<br>
aren't the rivers, the air,<br>
the forests or our mother earth,<br>
worthy of our acts of kindness?<br>
<br>
We are making rapid strides,<br>
from the micro to the nano,<br>
is it just in sci &amp;amp; tech, or does<br>
it coop in our loves and lives too?<br>
<br>
The world's a small place,<br>
the wise and learned say,<br>
is that why, not all have,<br>
a roof, under which to stay?<br>
<br>
Its a world of press n media,<br>
is it why we are pressed at,<br>
with news that's dubious,<br>
in truth and worth as well?<br>
<br>
We are all for world peace, they say,<br>
do you alone, make up "the world"? I ask<br>
How else would war, uncalled for<br>
bring about world peace?<br>

i am feeling terribly alone<br>
i feel like i did never before<br>
and this poem, therefore…<br>
<br>
is it cos a friend's gone<br>
to return, never again?<br>
but there are others around<br>
and of them, i'm proud<br>
<br>
is it cos i'm away<br>
from home, sweet home?<br>
but its been quite a long stay<br>
and i never felt so lonely…<br>

i wonder why, then<br>
do i feel terribly alone.<br>

<b>Update:</b> I found this during my not-so-random-blog-walks.
</p>

<p>
“..Alone is not a bad way to be;
</p>

<p>
it clears your head and focuses you on the journey.
</p>

<p>
Cherish the short intervals during the quest you have with others,
</p>

<p>
but be prepared to walk alone in the darkness.”[11/05/07]
</p>

<p>
<b>Update:</b> Interesting quote from a story…
</p>

<p>
“… no one is never really alone. Even when there is not other perso around, there still must be someone. Someone who made you  and therefore cares what happens to you. Someone who will help you if you do the best you can. So you're never alone. You can't be alone, no matter what you do. That's the secret of happiness, of doing things well, of everything…”

                <a href="/posts/planning-to-save-a-sem.html">Planning... to save a Sem!!??</a>
        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
We are less than a week away from our supposedly dreaded
'test-1'… n i have no clue even about what the syllabus is, in
each course… There's 'Theory of Relativity', of which i'm able
to make no head or tail.. then there's 'Electrical Sciences',
which totally "transformed" my plans for this
sem… then…SPM.. muP.. POM… MT.. C&amp;amp;S………
</p>

<p>
There are loads and loads of other stuff too…
</p>

<p>
Relativity… Emacs…. C++… Python… Table Tennis… learning
a bit of Music… picking up practical electronic
skills… reading a few books…(quite a few actually..).. and so
on…. [not to forget.. attending classes… doing a bit of course
related work…]. The list seems only to be growing everyday…
</p>

<p>
There's nothing that I've crossed out yet.. there's not one thing
that's done to perfection…[with a third of the sem already
through!!] {I already get the feeling.. its "Another sem down the
drain"}
</p>

<p>
But didn't I begin this sem with plans to "rock" it?? Wasn't I
supposed to attend all the classes that I possible can?? What's it
that I've been doing for the past 5-6 weeks?
</p>

<p>
I don't know!! I really can't pinpoint what's been achieved in the
past one month or so… [other than of course quite a considerable
amount of sleep…….]
</p>

<p>
Why are things so horribly out of place?? What's to be done.. to
get on track asap.. I wonder… What should my priorities be? Why
am I being overwhelmed by the things I got to do?
</p>

<p>
I realise this time of my life is as precious as any
other… (probably more…) and i need to make the most of
it…. but what is that "most"?? [It's definitely not sleep!]
</p>

<p class="verse">
I wish to put together,<br>
all my time, energy and matter<br>
to do a job, little<br>
that will ob'ly be infinitesimal<br>
It wouldn't make me a hero<br>
but shouldn't amount to zero…<br>
<br>
to me, something tangible<br>
definitely seems possible<br>
because nothing is impossible<br>
if there is the quantum of struggle…<br>
<br>
but it must come<br>
before I get back home<br>
needn't create an uproar<br>
but before the end of semsester four<br>
</p>

<p>
[Don't mistake this for a poem… for it is not!! Its just some
scribbling of mine.. which will keep me alive if at the end of
this sem… there's nothing other than this.. which is
tangible… something concrete.. something "see"able]
</p>

Sometimes I lie awake at night, and I ask, "Where have I gone
wrong?"  Then a voice inside says to me, "This is going to take
more than one night."  – Charles M. Schulz

<p class="verse">
Little Things.<br>
Little drops of water,<br>
Little grains of sand,<br>
Make the mighty ocean<br>
And the pleasant land.<br>
Thus the little minutes,<br>
Humble though they be,<br>
Make the mighty ages<br>
Of eternity.<br>
–  Ebenezer Cobham Brewer.<br>
