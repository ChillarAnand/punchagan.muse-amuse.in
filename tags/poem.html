The ripples on the quiet lake,<br>
twinkling stars on a moonless night,<br>
and his lonely, crazy, thoughts,<br>
yet again, his faithful companions<br>
on another of those countless nights,<br>
searching for meaning, awaiting the dawn.<br><br>
the night crawled by, as he drifted afloat,<br>
memories of the past and dreams of the future,<br>
until approaching footsteps, brought him back<br>
did the chill of the wind, get to his head?<br>
or was his guarded secret, not his anymore?<br><br>
Before his thoughts, collect, he could,<br>
his friend, from far away lands unknown,<br>
was there with him, to share his thoughts,<br>
to hear the wind hum the tunes of yore,<br>
while the stars and the lake, as a duo, danced.<br><br>
They watch the sun rise, from atop the hillock,<br>
basking in the warmth, and see the town wake up,<br>
lose themselves in the woods below,<br>
on their way back, rest by the lake shore,<br>
watching it, silently, shine in the daylight,<br>
letting it wet their feet and clear his head.<br><br>
Together, they cook themselves, a delicious meal,<br>
n enjoy it, with some of the choicest old wine.<br>
Catch-up on things, and yearn for more, discuss<br>
all the many things, under the sun, and over,<br>
without a clue, as to how much time flew by.<br><br>
Riding away, as fast as they could, they reach,<br>
just in time, as the sun set, over the seas,<br>
perched on bicycles, in mirrored positions, with<br>
resonating thoughts, the horizon, they watch<br>
the sun set, the beach light up, and the fair begin.<br><br>
They ate and drank, sung and danced and<br>
just had a good time, for the rest of the night,<br>
indulging, in all that the fair could offer.<br>
the night was long, but if wouldn't go on forever,<br>
pretty well, they knew, they day was to end.<br><br>
the twinkling stars they watched, yet again,<br>
but to the sea's song, on the still warm sand<br>
slowly, but steadily, into sleep he drifted,<br>
only to be awake, moments later, with the<br>
bright sun coming harshly down upon him,<br>
lighting up the lake, like a carpet of jewels.<br><br>
all he had, once again, were just his thoughts,<br>
the lake, and not the sea, by his side,<br>
with fading impressions of an impossible dream<br>
after all, wasn't it just too much action,<br>
for just one day, for a life engulfed by ennui?<br><br>
One some day, he told himself, and walked away.<br></p>

the time, together spent,<br>
the memories cherished,<br>
all the love, concern and care<br>
may they stay with us, for life.<br><br>
as high and far as you like<br>
may you fly, like you own the sky<br>
while I fumble, with my flying guide<br>
I see the world, through your eyes<br><br>
may you run, with all your might<br>
as if, fighting for life, you are.<br>
struggling to walk, I stumble and fall,<br>
but get up each time, inspired to run.<br><br>
may you, in all that we shared<br>
find strength to go on, if en-route<br>
our paths diverged; you may have to wait,<br>
but you shall see me, on the other side!<br></p>

Thanks to Chaitu, I re-read Love Unvoiced a few times and
realized, I was trying to say too much. Here's another poem,
with one part of what I wanted to say. I will not be writing
newer poems, to say the other stuff. Perform your own Fourier
analysis.

Hard, I tried, to stay mum,<br>
and keep it all within.<br>
But, not much longer can I stand,<br>
I give in, and here's my song<br><br>
wherever you are, anywhere you go,<br>
whatever you do, or choose not to,<br>
whatever you think and however you feel,<br>
my love for you, it shall only grow.<br><br>
Sweet, is the attachment,<br>
but let it not keep you from flying.<br>
the clear open sky, it's all yours<br>
fly! fly! fly!<br><br>
see all that you want to,<br>
and do all that you'd like to.<br>
to your hearts content, fly!<br>
without a care in the world, fly!<br><br>
for, if ever, you wish to rest,<br>
now you know, where to return<br>
right here, I shall be,<br>
with love, just a little more.<br><br>
Mute, I chose to be, but, boy!<br>
does it need to be told. All over me,<br>
it's written; and you, sure, read me!<br>
Love you, for being the more loving one!<br><br></p>

I'm not the body that dies<br>
on missing a beat or one breath.<br>
I'm not the mind, so fickle,<br>
I'm in heaven one moment, and next in hell.<br><br>
I'm the moments I live,<br>
not the ones, in which I just exist.<br>
I'm the dreams I dream,<br>
those fulfilled, and not just yet.<br><br>
I am the occasions I grace<br>
and those, missed, where I am.<br>
I am the words I spoke,<br>
those I wrote, and those I will.<br><br>
I am all that I create,<br>
and the stuff that I catalyse.<br>
I am the love I receive,<br>
and all of it that I spread.<br><br>
Don't cry, when I die,<br>
for I never really will.<br></p>

Come spring -<br>
a fresh lease of green<br>
drapes the bare branches.<br><br>
The leaves, dancing and whistling<br>
to the tunes of the wind<br>
playing, screaming, and singing,<br>
in each other's company, enjoying.<br><br>
Singing to one another<br>
promises of sticking together,<br>
come what may, through it all.<br><br>
The song goes on,<br>
but the count goes down,<br>
not noticed or just unacknowledged,<br>
first by one and then by many more.<br><br>
the song, still, goes on.<br>
And the promises too, of course.<br>
The song goes on and on and on.<br><br>
Until silence falls upon, when all<br>
of them are gone. The tree, knowing well,<br>
watches on - it won't be long before<br>
a new bunch springs up to sing the song.<br></p>

Achieve something, I'm often reminded,<br>
achieve something, something that's worthwhile.<br>
Don't just kill time, they say,<br>
for, brutally, it shall kill you someday.<br><br>
Make the best use of time, I tell myself,<br>
for I realize, how I spend my days<br>
is how I'm spending my life and<br>
I'm going to get just one of it!<br><br>
But, what is worthwhile, I wonder<br>
everything seems so good one moment<br>
and all meaning vanishes the very next.<br>
I'm utterly confused, somebody help!<br><br>
Pick one from, spoke my brother,<br>
the 'everything' that seems good<br>
and do it right, just, do it right!<br>
Life, as you live through it, shall<br>
teach you to do things that are right<br>
and at the end of it all, you'll<br>
never regret what you've done<br>
but, only what you couldn't!<br></p>

dead and lifeless, in a box I lie<br>
just my size, to be buried deep somewhere,<br>
arranged with flowers, bright and fragrant<br>

the final goodbye I have said,<br>
gone am I, never to return–but<br>
who am I, who am I, who am I?<br><br>
am I –<br>

the numerous battles I braved,<br>
where win or loss never, only a fight mattered.<br>
all those dreams I dared to dream,<br>
and the goals I never, or have, reached.<br><br>
None of it, I realised, am I,<br>

deep and loud, for one last time I wonder<br>
