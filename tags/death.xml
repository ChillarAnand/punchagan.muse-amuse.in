&lt;li&gt;State "DONE"       from ""           &lt;span class="timestamp-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;[2012-11-17 Sat 17:00]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

PyCon is back to Bangalore for the 4th edition.  I've been to all
the previous three editions, and I'm looking forward to this one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I haven't spoken at any of the previous editions, and hadn't
even really considered speaking at the previous editions.
But, this time, I proposed a couple of talks, and both of them
have been accepted! Woot! Lots of work ahead of me, but I'm
really looking forward to give good talks.  I'll be talking
about Enaml, and showing a brief demo of all the wonderful
things it makes possible.  In the other talk, I'll give a
brief overview of the latest happenings in the SciPy community
and the projects to look forward to and contribute to.  Pankaj
and I will be talking together on this.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Also, Kenneth (lawgon) will be deeply missed at this edition
of PyCon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sadly, John Hunter, the lead author of matplotlib, also passed
away last week.  RIP. :(
