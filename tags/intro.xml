Finally, I'm at Hacker School.  The day began with introductions,
breakfast and welcomes to HackerSchool.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The four rules of Hacker School were reiterated to all of us:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No (Feigning) surprise
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Well-actuallys
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Backseat driving
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Subtle-isms
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was made clear that each of us should watch ourselves not to break
these rules, and being called on breaking these rules is totally cool,
and we should stop about it and think for a moment and move-on.
Breaking the rules doesn't make us bad hacker schoolers.  We are all
here to learn!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I liked the idea of all of us being asked to list out the things that
we are nervous about, and excited about.  I was happy to find that a
lot of the people were nervous about the similar kinds of things I was
nervous about.  I'm not alone!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After the check-ins, I started off with the Introduction to &lt;a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/"&gt;Haskell course&lt;/a&gt; by
&lt;a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/"&gt;Brent Yorgey&lt;/a&gt;.  What I did was mostly a recap of what I learned from the first
few chapters of &lt;a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com"&gt;Learn you a Haskell&lt;/a&gt;.  I learnt about how credit card numbers
are validated, apart from learning a little bit about lazy evaluation and
thunks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The day ended with burritos and game night Mafia!
