&lt;li&gt;Amber &lt;a href="http://www.subsymbol.org/2014/06/hacker-school-tuesday-june-17th-2014.html"&gt;talked about&lt;/a&gt; "exploring only until the current task is done"
and moving on, which is could really be a lost opportunity to learn
something new and gain a better understanding of the system I am
working with.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having something (anything not directly related to the current
project I'm working on) scheduled for later in the day, doesn't seem
to do me much good. I feel distracted for quite a long period before
the scheduled time.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abstractions and layers were talked about in the second exercise on
Applicatives… Layering, FTW!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent about an hour or so in the afternoon reading the paper, &lt;a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gkrichar/papers/onward2013-wuerthinger-truffle.pdf"&gt;One
VM to rule them all&lt;/a&gt;.  It talked about Truffle: an API to implement
an AST parser for any language and Graal: a JIT compiler for the
ASTs.  Later in the day, I also went to the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/events/178049922/"&gt;Papers we love&lt;/a&gt; meetup.
The presentation and the talks were quite interesting!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also started looking at &lt;a href="http://elm-lang.org"&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt; and playing with it.
&lt;/li&gt;
