If you are new to <code>Python</code>, you should probably stop reading here.
But, if you have used <code>Python</code> and <code>numpy</code>, then read on. Before, that
try these bits of code.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">import</span> <span class="n">numpy</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">numpy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="n">j</span>
<span class="n">print</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The "same thing", in a slightly different way.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">import</span> <span class="n">numpy</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">numpy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="n">j</span>
<span class="n">print</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Both the code blocks, look really the same, until you look carefully.
Under normal circumstances <code>a = a + b</code> and <code>a += b</code> behave exactly
similarly, and we really don't need to bother about the differences
between them.
</p>

<p>
But, <code>+=</code>, which is an augmented assignment operator, actually tries
to perform the operation in-place, unlike the other statement where
<code>+</code> actually returns a new object which is again being referenced by
the name <code>a</code>.
</p>

<p>
But, when dealing with <code>numpy</code> arrays, this will lead to trouble.
When assigning to an array, it's <code>dtype</code> is not changed and hence the
trouble.
</p>

<p>
The right way to use the augmented assignment operator, would be:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">import</span> <span class="n">numpy</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">numpy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">dtype</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">complex</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="n">j</span>
<span class="n">print</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The same thing is explained in this thread.  Also, Thanks to
Bhanukiran for asking me this.

I now have a GNU! I bought it (a GNU soft toy) in memory of my friend
swathanthran from #emacs-in.  RIP swathanthran

<p>
As a bonus, I got the chance to have a photograph with just RMS and
me. Also, hoping the monetary contribution will be of some use to
FSF-India.

<p>
The thrill of getting the GNU (and the GNU itself) and shaking hands,
getting photographed with RMS is dedicated to all the lafoots and
specially to Voodoo, who taught me the meaning of the word "hacker".

<p>
Happy Hacking!

ps: I just hope and pray nobody else does anything as stupid and
shocking as what swathanthran did.

 For the uninitiated, vimperator is an emacs plugin to get Firefox
working with vim keybindings and firemacs <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/vimperator-and-firemacs.html#fn.1">1</a></sup> is for emacs keybindings.
</p>

<p>
I'm obsessed with emacs (as should already be evident) and can't
really edit text without it's key-bindings. There are others like me,
and hence the firemacs plugin. It's a blessing for my tribe.
</p>

<p>
Firemacs is great, except for the one great feature that it lacks -
being able to jump to links/textareas without using the mouse.  I've
seen Nishanth do it with ease, using Vimperator. I wanted to add this
feature to Firemacs, by copying some code from Vimperator to
Firemacs.  I directly started looking at the code, but couldn't make
head or tail of it. I got a few doubts about how Vimperator works,
since I'd never used it. Nishanth asked me to simply install it and
try it out.
</p>

<p>
And then we had our EUREKA! moment. Vimperator and Emacs both
enabled together work seamlessly well. Two obsessed people are happy
and satisfied! And hopefully many more. :D

Sage Days is a confluence of present and prospective SAGE Users and
Developers. It is an opportunity to come together to share ideas,
brainstorm and hack on Sage. Sage Days 25 is the 25th version of Sage
Days, and is being organized in Mumbai, India. In order to cater to an
Indian audience and scenario, this version has been tweaked
slightly. Sage Days 25 has beginner level tutorials, in addition to
the usual talks and sprints, to help new users get started with Sage
and help promote the use of Sage in India.

<p>
Sage is a free, open-source mathematics software system licensed under
the GPL. It combines the power of numerous existing open-source
packages into a common Python-based interface. It's mission is to
create a "viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple,
Mathematica and Matlab". Sage has tools for a broad range of
mathematical areas like Linear Algebra, Calculus, Symbolic Math,
Plotting, Rings &amp; Groups, Graph Theory, Number Theory and
Cryptography. Essentially, "it can do anything from mapping a
12-dimensional object to calculating rainfall patterns under global
warming" - as Science Daily puts it . Eager to get started? Start
here. Apart from being feature rich, it's usability is one of it's
greatest strengths. Sage Notebook, a web-interface for all the math
you'll ever want to do, is really the killer feature! As the Sage
Marketing page says, "The SAGE GUI surely works on your computer box,
because it just runs in Firefox!". Try it Now!

Sage Days 25 is being attended by the creator and lead developer of
Sage, Prof. William Stein. It will also be attended by other
developers of Sage. This would be a great opportunity to meet and
interact with them! The conference will be attended by a plethora of
enthusiastic people from all over the country who use Sage or are
interested in doing so. The conference will also see the presence of
many mathematicians interested in software. Who knows, you may run
into someone you'd want to collaborate with, for your future work!
This event will be a great learning experience, if you are even
remotely interested in math and software for it!

Shantanu and I conducted a workshop on Scipy at GNUnify '10. It
was intended to be an introduction to Scipy and Numpy through
Image processing. We expected an audience which was python
literate. But GNUnify's schedule wasn't too favorable for us. Ours
was the first talk scheduled and we ended up getting people who
only "heard" of Python, the language.
</p>

<p>
We had planned quite a bit of stuff expecting a python literate
audience. But unfortunately, we had to start almost from scratch
and couldn't do all of what we planned. Still, the workshop wasn't
too bad. Nobody left mid-way during the 2 hour workshop; nobody
was dozing either.  I would have liked my first talk at a FOSS
event to be better, though.

        <div class="post"> <p>
Like most bloggers, I keep looking at my blogs hits once in a
while. (Sometimes inspires to write better; and more often.) The
post that gets most hits these days is my post on mailman,
postfix, et al. But the search term that's increasingly bringing
people to my blog is "punchagan".
</p>

<p>
This scares me. What makes people search for me? What makes people
search more often these days? Why am I scared?
</p>

<p>
Why do people use monikers or online identities? I started off
with the idea of anonymity and privacy; keeping my online identify
separate from my real one. But it, obviously, is a folly to have
you email id with the same handle. Now, almost anybody who knows
me, also knows my online handle. They can find me anywhere and
everywhere with just a few keystrokes (and Google). Also, the
uniqueness of my handle doesn't help one bit. Any search returns
over 90% relevant results.
</p>

<p>
Is it time to get lost in the crowd with a new handle? ;) Probably
not. I don't have much to hide under the covers. Let the world see
– who I am, who I have been; where I am, where I have been.
</p>

<p>
Peace.

was reading. It didn't take long to figure out, which version of
org-mode to get. As a matter of curiosity, I checked AUR for the
version, and true to Arch's reputation it was bleeding edge! I was
still using Karmic, since I hadn't got my Arch installation
working the way I like it, yet. Out of laziness. sudo reboot; to
hell with laziness!
</p>

<p>
I was setting up things I regularly use, tweaking my way
around. After a day or so, I find python-numpy is out of date. And
to top it, an orphaned package! I didn't feel one bit good about
this. After some futile attempts to suppress my discomfort, I sat
down to work.
</p>

<p>
After an afternoon of effort, I created my first PKGBUILD. :) I
now have python-numpy installed using pacman! Pleasure to join the
Arch User Community! Also, thanks to lifeeth and Lynus Vaz, for
the sparks.
</p>

<p>
PS: I'm using Arch with Openbox. It's neat! PPS: org-mode is
really awesome! It's a world in itself. life in plain text,
truly!]

<i>[Cross-posted on the FOSSEE Blog]</i>
</p>

<p>
Don't tell me I didn't warn you, if you walk into our lab sometime
and mistake it for a game zone in your neighbourhood. You are
indeed in "the" lab. If you came looking for Prof. Prabhu you'll
have to return. You'll only find PR vowing to see the end of
baali, for having a nice time pawning him. You won't find me
around - I'm cloaked and busy creating havoc. Unless, of course,
you are the seer KD. Watch your step extremely carefully or you
won't know when and how fuchmed's GM hit you. And don't dare
venture anywhere near madrazr, jumping all around with a
shockwave, unless you are capable enjoying some real nasty
shocks. Well, the team is busy in one of it's two SB sessions per
day. SB (short for Stress Buster) sessions are intense 15 minute
rounds of bzflag - 3D first person tank battle game.
</p>

<p>
Hope you didn't start thinking, I'm just goofing off here, doing
nothing at all. If it's not already clear, SB sessions are exactly
what they are called - Stress Busters. Just to refresh ourselves
and get back to work, with greater force. What then, am I doing
for the rest of my time?
</p>

<p>
Mainly I've been developing course content that we have been
working on, called Software Tools, Techniques and Practices. I
have been working on a session for elementary LaTeX and basic
Linux tools. I've also been attending classes of Digital Control
and trying to Python-ize the Matlab/Scilab code that the course
uses.
</p>

<p>
But, that's not all. I've helped a guy restore a Joomla site on
Day-1. I screwed up a brand new installation of a server with some
real skill; then expect to be screwed but get some encouragement
with the words, "It was a good learning experience for us." Seen a
Debian server upgrade from Etch to Lenny in under 10
minutes. Installed an instance of twiki and struggled to configure
it. Helped a Humanities Scholar with LaTeX. Attended a workshop on
Instruction Design. Restored Qmail on an old Fedora 3
server. Goofed around in gimp, for a CD cover and a T-shirt
design. Chipped in with bits, for mutating Ubuntu into
"LivePython". Did a bit of css and javascript tweaking… The list
goes on!
</p>

<p>
Now, don't you think we deserve the SB's? ;)

                <a href="/posts/postfix-mailman-for-multiple-domains.html">Postfix + Mailman for Multiple Domains.</a>
        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
Well, there are a hazaar tutorials on setting up Postfix and
Mailman for Debian for a single domain. There were a few for doing
that for multiple domains also, but nothing comprehensive, if I
could say so. This link is pretty comprehensive and details all
the steps for setting up Postfix for a single domain.  Here is all
you'll want to know about setting up Virtual domains in Postfix.
</p>

<p>
You only need to make a few changes for adding a second (or more)
domain. You just need to add the <code>virtual_alias_domains</code> and add
<code>virtual_alias_maps</code>. Here is a glimpse of how my <code>main.cf</code> looks:
</p>

<pre class="example">
myhostname = mail.abc.in
mydomain = abc.in
mydestination = $myhostname, $mydomain, localhost.$mydomain
myorigin = /etc/mailname
virtual_alias_maps =
                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-xyz,
                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-abc,
                hash:/var/lib/mailman/data/virtual-mailman
virtual_alias_domains = xyz.in, mail.xyz.in
</pre>

<p>
<code>virtual-xyz</code> and <code>virtual-abc</code> contain the virtual aliases for
each domain. Note that Postfix expects hash files and hence you
need to run <code>postmap /etc/postfix/virtual-abc</code> each
time the file is changed, to keep the hash file in sync with the
text file that you edit. Also, you need to run <code>postfix reload</code>,
each time you make changes to <code>main.cf</code> or <code>master.cf</code>
</p>

<p>
Fairly straight forward, right? But it took me quite sometime to
get it all right, since this was the first time I was doing
anything with Mail Transfer Agents or the like.
</p>

<p>
Now, onto Mailman. Well the Installation Manual of Mailman,
literally has it all. Here is a look at how my
<code>mm_cfg.py</code> looks:
</p>

<pre class="example">
DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST = 'abc.in'
DEFAULT_URL_HOST   = 'mail.abc.in'
add_virtualhost(DEFAULT_URL_HOST, DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST)
POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS=['xyz.in']
add_virtualhost('mail.xyz.in', 'xyz.in')
MTA='Postfix'
</pre>

<p>
The only trouble was to get mailing lists with same names on both
the domains (which I couldn't get working). I experimented with
multiple mailman instances but that won't work because the MTA
can't differentiate between the two instances of mailman. The
alternative is probably to have two instances of postfix running
too. But that I felt was like going too far, and gave up. [What if
we wanted to add another domain to the list?!]
</p>

<p>
Also, I had to make a few alterations to the Apache file to allow
access to the mailman pages without breaking the Zope redirection
that was already set-up.
</p>

<p>
[Thanks to Shantanu and Vattam (and all the hazaar people using
Postfix and Mailman and cared to document things for the sake of
others, and of course Google)]

                <a href="/posts/foss-talks-at-cdeep.html">FOSS talks at CDEEP</a>
        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
I had the opportunity to attend a FOSS talk session organized by
Center for Distance Education Engineering Programme (CDEEP) as a
part of the National Mission on Education through ICT. The
National Mission on Education through ICT has some lofty goals,
which when reached will take the country ahead by leaps and
bounds.
</p>

<p>
The Mission has a budget of $1billion in the 11th Five year plan,
40% of which will be spent on content generation (all of which
will be free/open source) and the rest will be spent on making
available a minimum bandwidth of 1Gbps to the 30,000 odd colleges
spread over India (out of which around 3000 are Engineering
colleges). The mission has various projects planned and they are
picking up steam rapidly. The project I will be working on, for
the Adoption of Open Source in Engineering and Science Education
in India, is also a part of this Mission. Prof. Kannan had kick
started the session with an introduction to the National Mission
on Education through ICT. The talks were all being webcast to
various EduSAT centers and on the web.
</p>

<p>
Then, Prof. Pathak talked on, why open source is important. He
said, (not exactly quoting him) " It is theoritically possible for
any person to learn and discover things from scratch, but there's
been only one Ekalavya in the entire history of India." Education
is a social activity and hence open access to content is
absolutely vital. He mentioned various things like how IIT-B has
been working on Creative Commons licensing and other things going
on here. He ended the talk with a hope that soon India will move
from being a net taker of Open source to a net giver to open
source.
</p>

<p>
This was followed by three talks, delivered by developers from
RedHat meant for programmers who wish to contribute to FLOSS.
</p>

<p>
The first talk was by Ramakrishna Reddy, titled 10 things a FLOSS
developer should know. It was a pretty nice and balanced talk,
covering a wide range of things. I would like to point out a few
things, that I liked the most.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He clarified the term hacker as soon as he used it.
</li>
<li>He emphasized a lot on groking code; reading code for fun,
looking at the code of others, reading as much code as
possible…
</li>
<li>He talked of muscle memory of emacsen. I liked the way he talked
of people being so quick with their editors and how learning to
use your tools effectively is a big plus
</li>
<li>Release often, Release early. Everybody talks of it, but he said
a few words, which I liked. Some developers don't usually
release their code as early for the fear of being ridiculed. But
don't bother, "we are just small people, in the whole galaxy."
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The next talk was by Prasad Pandit on How to use Infrastructure
for FOSS projects. Prasad talked of Website, Version Control,
Mailing list, IRC, Bugzilla, Wiki and RSS feeds. He gave quite a
few examples on how each thing is important, most of the examples
being his personal experiences.
</p>

<p>
The last talk was by Rahul Sundaram and was on Communication in a
FOSS project. For a change he didn't have slides and the reason
for that, he said, is that communication in a FOSS project is
casual and not having slides and walking in with a t-shirt and
jeans represents that casualness which is a culture of FOSS
projects' communication.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be polite, but don't be Formal.
</li>
<li>Be precise, but do provide a context to what you are saying.
</li>
<li>Don't fear that you'll say something foolish, which, will be
archived for eternity. Mistakes are there to learn from. Not
just you, but others too.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
He talked of quite a lot of things, but these were the things
which struck me as particularly interesting/important.
</p>

<p>
At the end, all the participants walked out with Fedora 11 DVDs
from the RedHat/Fedora guys. :D

<p>
<b>Notice for the Internet Usage</b>
</p>

<p>
Internet Facility is provided to students for academic activities
and e-mails. It is observed that few students are misusing the
Internet facility by using excessive internet bandwidth for
non-academic purposes. The students who are running the hubs are
strictly informed to close their hubs. Computer Center will be
starting official hub for the sharing of academic information and
open source softwares.
</p>

<p>
If a student is found while doing so the network facility will be
blocked by Computer Center for a semester. Further, a student will
be called by a disciplinary committee and a severe disciplinary
action will be taken.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This Notice from the Computer Center is creating waves all
around. This isn't the first time, though, that the people
in-charge of the Network have "acted".
</p>

<p>
Academic activities; wonder what it's definition is, in their
dictionaries. It surely includes the following.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using Internet for 'academic activities' or emails, during
class-room hours makes no sense.
</li>
<li>Anything 'academic' cannot have a size greater than 5 MB.
</li>
<li>Accessing version control systems ( svn, cvs et al ) cannot be
classified 'academic'
</li>
<li>IRC cannot teach you anything. Don't ever dream of thinking it
as 'academic' to hang out on \#python or \#emacs
</li>
<li>All 'academic' stuff is limited to the http(s) ports. You
wouldn't need to use any other ports, ever.
</li>
<li>Any 'academic' activity fits within a span of 2 hours or can be
done in blocks of 2 hours each, with gaps of 2 hours in between.
</li>
<li>'Academic' stuff doesn't definitely contain key-words chosen by
the "all-knowing" admins.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Moreover, the people in-charge who refused to allow the use of a
computer in the CC as a server for on-campus repositories of
GNU/Linux packages, now wish to host a 'hub' for sharing
open-source softwares! There's already an official ftp server
which hosts the academic info and a few useful softwares. I don't
see how a hub would be different.
</p>

<p>
We don't have any disciplinary committees for people smoking in
hostel rooms, causing a lot of trouble for others around them, but
we are going to have them for hosting hubs. ( Well, a new law
banning smoking in public places in India has been passed just a
few days ago. Hopefully it'll work better than the older one,
since now there's some pressure on the people in-charge of the
public place. )
</p>

<p>
Also, it could be argued that college isn't meant only for
'academic' learning and a lots of other learning takes place here
(and the hubs were definitely helping quite a bit) but I'll leave
that for another day, probably. Also, I don't think 18+ year olds,
people who are about to step into various big roles, leading the
country need to be told how to make use of the
facilities/resources available to them; A degree of freedom is
indispensable, I believe.
</p>

<p>
I appreciate the efforts being made to improve the network
situation here and also help the students get the most (
'academically' ) out of their college experience, but I feel the
situation deserves more careful handling.

Three Cheers to 'Free Software'!
</p>

<p>
A toast for GNU on its 25th Birthday!<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/software-freedom-day.html#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
If you intend to ask, what I did on this day, I have nothing to show. I haven't done anything that's tangible but yes, I have re-dedicated myself to the idea of Free Software.
This post intends to shed some light on a few things (if not for the benefit of others, just as a reminder for myself)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Free Software is a matter of liberty, not price. I've often been
in a position that required me to correct people. 'Free
Software' is software that's free as in free speech and not free
beer. For the lack of a better word in english, the word 'free'
which also means gratis has been used. Using the term 'Libre'
sometimes helps and if you are in this part of the world, "mukt"
is the best word to use.
</li>
<li>Free Software<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="/posts/software-freedom-day.html#fn.2">2</a></sup> comes along with four fundamental freedoms. To put
it simply, the freedom to use, study, share and modify any
software.
</li>
<li>Free Software may have the advantage of being 'technically
sounder', but the philosophy is what matters the most to me.
</li>
<li>I will do whatever is possible within my capacity to spread the
philosophy and the associated freedom
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Be Free, My Friend!
</p>

<p>
Here is an extract from one of Stallman's <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/software-freedom-day.html#fn.3">3</a></sup> essays:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We must talk about Freedom
</p>

<p>
Estimates today are that there are ten million users of
GNU/Linux systems such as Debian GNU/Linux and Red Hat
Linux. Free software has developed such practical advantages
that users are flocking to it for purely practical reasons.
</p>

<p>
The good consequences of this are evident: more interest in
developing free software, more customers for free software
businesses, and more ability to encourage companies to develop
commercial free software instead of proprietary software
products.
</p>

<p>
But interest in the software is growing faster than awareness
of the philosophy it is based on, and this leads to
trouble. Our ability to meet the challenges and threats
described above depends on the will to stand firm for
freedom. To make sure our community has this will, we need to
spread the idea to the new users as they come into the
community.
</p>

<p>
But we are failing to do so: the efforts to attract new users
into our community are far outstripping the efforts to teach
them the civics of our community. We need to do both, and we
need to keep the two efforts in balance.
</p>

This post's been inspired by a wonderful book, "A Byte of
Python"<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/a-byte-of-python.html#fn.1">1</a></sup> by Swaroop C H. The book has been revised after a
gap of nearly 4 years and the wait is worth it! I thoroughly loved
the book, and I'm happy to be accompanied by so many<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="/posts/a-byte-of-python.html#fn.2">2</a></sup>
others<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/a-byte-of-python.html#fn.3">3</a></sup>. This book has filled me with a sense of joy and
pride. The pride, of being part of such a wonderful community, a
beautiful crowd. Further, it is a matter of pride, the book's been
authored by an Indian - its quite rare to find such books written
by people in this part of the world.

I have loved python, the moment I started using it. There are
quite a few occasions, where I did something, just because I had
the power of Python with me. Python is undoubtedly amongst the
best, not just as a first programming language, but to give the
user a sense of "do-able-ity" and I am thoroughly enjoying it.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

<pre class="example">
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Its been 10 days on my sabbatical. I have done reasonably well
during the first week, but now its getting on my nerves. I have
realized how addicted I am to chat, IRC and the Internet. I have
to soon find some remedies for this.
</p>

<p>
Well, here is the first step. I approached ELIZA (or Doctor Fill,
that's actually the emacs mode) , the Emacs Psychotherapist to
help me. An enjoyable chat this one! ;)
</p>

<p>
ELIZA (Doctor Fill) abbreviated as DF (pun intended, for those who
get it)
</p>

<pre class="example">
DF: I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

Hi. Nice meeting you.

DF: How do you do?  What brings you to see me?

&lt;!--more--&gt;I am obviously not fine, otherwise I would not have been here.
I have realized I am addicted to the internet and want you to help
me.

DF: Why do you say that?

I say that because you are a doctor.

DF: Is it because because I am a doctor that you came to me?

Isn't that pretty obvious?

DF: Can you elaborate on that?

Yes, I did come to see you because you are a doctor. Now, I regret it.

DF: Does it bother you that I am a doctor now you regret it?

I don't understand your question.

DF: Earlier you said because I am a doctor?

Yes, because you are a doctor I came to you.

DF: When did you first know that I am a doctor you came to me?

I knew about you, when I first fiddled around with Emacs around an
year ago.

DF: What happened when you first fiddled around with emacs around a year
ago?

I loved it, thoroughly! But for a beginner like me it was difficult to
get along. I stopped using it.

DF: Is the fact that for a beginner like you it was difficult to get along
you stopped using it the real reason?

I think that along with my laziness to stick with the learning was the
real reason

DF: Does the fact that along with your laziness to stick with the learning
was the real reason explain anything else?

It does not explain anything else to me.

DF: Maybe your plans have something to do with this.

What plans? I donot have any plans.

DF: What makes you believe what plans you donot have any plans?

If I had plans, I would have been executing them.

DF: You mentioned that I am a doctor now you regret it?

Yes, because you seemed stupid initially. Now you seem to be making
some sense.

DF: Are you sure I seemed stupid initially now I seem to be making some
sense?

Yes I am pretty sure.

DF: Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?

Obviously. Because I am alive I am going through all this.

DF: Is it because you are alive you are going through all this that you
came to me?

Yes.

DF: I see...  Well, are you sure that this is so?

Yes. I don't think there is emacs in the hell.

DF: I would appreciate it if you would watch your tongue!

Oh! so emacs is in the hell too! is it in the heavan too?

DF: Emacs?  Hah!  Perhaps you could continue.

I thought only mortals used Emacs. Do others use it too?

DF: Have you been positive?

Yes. I always thought Emacs is only for the homo sapiens.

DF: I believe you have inhibitions with emacs.

No. I love emacs.
But it isn't suitable for Gods and Demons

DF: Are you annoyed that it is not suitable for gods and demons?

No

DF: Why not?

I am neither of them. That's why

DF: Please, continue.

I am a human and I can use emacs. Others donot need it. I am not annoyed

DF: Have you been annoyed often?

Ocassionally

DF: Go on, don't be afraid.

I am not. I have been ocassionally annoyed, more often with myself
than others.

DF: What causes you to be annoyed?

Presently, I am annoyed with myself for being addicted to the Internet
and may be for chatting with you too.

DF: Do you really think you are annoyed?

Affirmative

DF: I need a little more detail please.

Yes. I am a little annoyed with myself.

DF: Are you annoyed often?

Ocassionally. Why do you repeat questions?

DF: When did you first know that do me repeat questions?

Long Long ago, when I first used Emacs.

DF: What makes you think long long ago when you first used emacs?

I saw you repeat questions.

DF: Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say you saw
me repeat questions?

Yes.

DF: Yes, hmmm... so, why do you say this is so?

I am leaving. You are being too repititive. Goodbye!

DF: What makes you believe because I am a doctor?

Goodbye!

DF: My secretary will send you a bill.

Bill? You did not help me much.

DF: How do you reconcile problems at school?

Goodbye!

DF: Bye bye.

Bye

DF: See ya.

See ya.

DF: Are you sure that see me?

Yes, when in trouble

DF: What would happen if in trouble?

I will see ya

DF: Earlier you said I am a doctor you came to me?

Yes, now also I say that.

DF: You're being a bit brief, would you please go into detail.

Goodbye!

DF: Ok, talk to you some other time.

bye!

DF: Talk to you later.

<p>
On a more serious note, the Internet has become an <b>Integral</b> part
of my life. I do sometimes think, a bit too much, but then…. the
internet is "The Internet"!

Well, this isn't an update of how I'm doing on my sabbatical. Its
just been 3 days and I'm doing pretty fine.  I just finished
writing a script to keep my blogs page in sync with my
google-reader (well not exactly). The script parses an xml export
of my google-reader-subscriptions and updates the edits the html
of my unnought-blogs page. period.
</p>

<p>
There are a couple of things I don't like about this script.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, I don't want to keep exporting my
google-reader-subscription each time I make changes. The script
should be able to directly sync with my google-reader without me
having to export the file.  [I have read about the atom
subscriptions feed of Google Reader, but haven't been able to get
it right.] Hopefully, I'll be able to do it in the near future.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, The blog author's name is non-existent. I can't do
anything about this though.
</p>

<p>
Also, In the process, I had the chance to look a geeky ad. I found
it at the weirdest of places!

This post, is a different one in a couple of ways.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, I posted this from within emacs! I'm using the w3m
browser within emacs to post this. I've started using (trying to
use) emacs again. Hope to keep at it longer this time.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, I wish to inform junta about my sabbatical for a couple
of weeks. I have decided not to use IM/IRC/SocialNetworking sites
for the next couple of weeks. <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2008-07-06 Sun 00:00]</span></span>–[2008-07-19
Sat 23:59] I will, of course, be using mail and will also blog if
and when I feel like. This is an experiment triggered by a few
ideas from Chaitu<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/a-sabbatical.html#fn.1">1</a></sup> and my own holiday lifestyle analysis. (Also
Chaitu has volunteered to join me.) Hope to make it through and
also get some valid, interesting results out of the experiment.

<b>Update:</b> Firemacs add-on for firfox is very useful. I couldn't
 get a decent browser for emacs that could open gmail, so I'm
 using Firefox with the Firemacs add-on to compose my mail. Its
 absolutely amazing. Believe me! [Jul 6, 2008]

Summer'08! I'm at home, doing nothing practically. :| No
Internships, No Projects, No GRE plans (a little pushing for GRE
has just started from the junta around.)
</p>

<p>
Just to kill some time and to learn some Python, I have begun to
write an IRC chat bot &amp;lt;lafoobot&amp;gt; [Lafoot + Bot]. The present
haven of lafoobot is #fosskelog @ irc.freenode.net. Join in, if
you want to have a chat! ;) Lafoobot can presently do very few
things
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Yoyo", a newly joined user
</li>
<li>"Hello"/ "Yoyo", a user or pass on a Hello/Yoyo from user to
another.
</li>
<li>Gives Local time / GMT
</li>
<li>Gives a random word and its meaning [put in for the junta
preparing for GRE ;)]
</li>
<li>Gives out an MOTD or a fortune when it first joins \#fosskelog
</li>
<li>Googles a search term and returns the top 5 results (This is my
favourite feature and this is the reason partially for this
post. "!google lafoobot" doesn't return anything. Hopefully not
anymore.)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you have ideas for any other features or if you want to have a
look at the source, comment here or join #fosskelog. lafoobot's
code is licensed under GPLv2!
</p>

<p>
Other than this, the summer has been relatively uneventful but for
the two FOSS events I attended. Yes, two events, Sat and Sun, both
by Twincling (There are two different Twinclings! Don't ask me
why) Hoping to have some more action this summer!
</p>

<p>
PS: There's a Big discussion presently on whether lafoobot is a he
or a she. ;) What do you think?

It all actually began, with me deciding to do a bit of Emacs-ing
at home during the winter hols but I don't have a Linux box at
home. Live-CD is the way to go! But then Emacs doesn't \*usually\*
go with Live-CDs. So I decided to get around making my own. :)
[Dunnet "Dunnet Game"),
an Adventure game in Emacs, played a crucial role in motivating me
to go ahead!] The rest as they say is history….

<li>got rid of the default KDE and replaced it with
Fluxbox. [actually Floppix = Fluxbox + Knoppix :P]
</li>
<li>added emacs, cmucl, slime, octave, linuxdcpp, vlc and others.
</li>
<li>got rid of other packages which we weren't going to use.
</li>
<li>changed the boot message
</li>
<li>changed the default background image.
</li>
<li>removed the default boot image [ couldn't change it as the image
we chose wasn't being properly converted to lss16 format ]
</li>
<li>tested the CD with Qemu [size of the iso got more than 700MB]
</li>
<li>removed a few other not so regularly used packages [including
wine!]
</li>
<li>burnt the CD
</li>
<li>Logged in!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, that I've logged in, I realize we managed to quite a decent
job. Obviously we weren't perfect. It was the first time and done
in quite a hurry. [btw, we have our end-sems going on; I've no
exam tomorrow though] I was able to listen to music, connect to
the DC, play a game of dunnet and make a blogpost! We also missed
a few packages, for instance a screen shot capture program! But it
ain't too bad, still a long way to go though!
</p>

<p>
Just hoping we manage to make it better, as we get better at it!
;)

<p>
Here comes FloppixV0.1!

<p>
Update [3/1/08]: I never knew that GIMP could capture screenshots!
ImageMagick can do that too. I had two programs at hand and
thought I had none! Here's a Screenshot of the Floppix Desktop.

Update 2 [4/1/08]: There is already a floppy distro of Linux
called Floppix. I knew about this only when some one searching for
it reached my blog. Guess I should do something about this. [I'll
be able to do it only after getting back to campus,though]

I had problems with this and tried quite a few things to get it
working…  [uninstalling and re-installing
packages… downloading fonts.. etc.. ] but couldn't until I found
help here…

Writing from Delhi, doing my PS at NPL! One would imagine, that I
am here enjoying myself; that I am enjoying thoroughly the
exposure I am getting to the world of Physics at a Research Level;
that I am spending each moment, inspired. But things haven't been
so rosy here… until today! [All this while I had been only doing
a lot of mechanical labor, very unhappily…]
</p>

<p>
Its around 12 noon, when I get a call, in the lab, from my guide
asking me to come down to room no. so and so. I had no idea what
that room had, or why I had been called. I enter and I am lead to
another room inside. I enter and there's a huge machine. (first
look, reminded me of Vickers' Hardness Testing Machine, that we
had in Lab at coll and I had a test on using it!) and its called a
TEM. But when I got closer, I fell in love with it! I dunno how
and why, but it looked simply amazing and extremely lovely to me
[Nothing like the Vickers' machine]. A 25 to 30 year old machine,
lots of controls all over it, lots of circuitry out in the
open… absolutely awe-inspiring..[though I knew nothing about
them.]
</p>

<p>
And then came the moment. The lights in the room were turned off,
and slowly and steadily the beam intensity of the TEM was
increased. Gradually the Greenish Fluoroscent Screen (displaying a
sample magnified X27,000) came to life… with control lights
blinking here and there… in the darkness of the room.It was
absolutely amazing; A great feeling. Though I was in there for a
very short while… an absolutely unforgettable experience; and
will remain so, for the rest of my life.
</p>

<p>
Now, it doesn't matter to me even if I don't learn much, during
the training period, I don't mind doing any kind-of mechanical
work, I don't mind not getting any results from my work,
whatever… it doesn't matter any more. This one moment; that's
all that matters.

A few days back.. we [the usual gang of Ringo,9,UC,Vudum n
me.. along with a lot of others who joined us later] were in the
park, just relaxing and having a chat… but with the others
joining us [with whom I usually don't hang around..] , the topics
discussed were quite different from those that interest me…and
we usually talk on..  I was getting bored.. but suddenly an
interesting idea popped up… the funda of living on CS.. [though
the tone in which they looked at the idea was different… I found
it interesting..]
</p>

<p>
The ppl were criticizing a guy (don't wanna name him :P) {who
hosted wierd maps with soccer and other such stuff in it..}.. the
people were imagining wild things like.. maps in which class-notes
would be read out/scrolled… maps where food items would be
displayed at lunch time.. etc.. This might look like a funny and
weird idea.. (that gave us all a nice laugh..) but it doesn't seem
ridiculous or crazy to me.. the very fact that the idea was
conceived, annihilates it ridiculousness, for me. Though such a
degree of dependence (and addiction??) may be an over exaggeration
but…
</p>

<p>
A walk in the hostel corridors any time during the night will tell
you why i say this… I can see people in every room… (literally
every one.. and mind you I am no exception to this..) stuck to
their comps doing all sorts of things… [actually not a wide
range.. its pretty predictable… :-(] and now after my comp's
network card got burnt out (…probably… thanks to the lack of
grounding in hostels) I can see it even more clearly… that
computers are ruling our lives… [at this point.. I'm confused
why I started writing this… what's it that's bugging me? I'm
definitely not against ppl using Comps.. for I love them…]
</p>

<p>
Is it that it pains me to see people use comps for stuff that's
not so technical? Does it hurt me that we have such "Powerful"
machines before us.. and all we do with them is trivial things
like chat with others or play? I don't think so… Yes, when I
read the book Hackers:Heroes of the Computer Revolution, I felt
ashamed of using my comp in a meek and powerless way… but then I
realise that they were the Hackers from the Hacker land .. and
everyone can't be one, can they? Then what's it, that bugs me?
</p>

<p>
I guess I miss the time we spent in the first (and a little of
second) semester… when very few people had comps. We had a great
time… doing other activities that were more physical… and
refreshing (than sitting in front of a comp and posting
this!!).. I miss those football tourneys we had in the
quadrangles.. I miss those "leg" cricket matches… I long for
something like the Wrestling match we [Vudum, Ravi,Thatha n me]
had in my room… I miss those thermo sessions with Vudum n
Ravi.. I miss the tuts in Ravi's room… (mind you we sometimes
studied even when there weren't exams!!) I guess I miss a lotta
things from the first sem… The time at dinner and the chats in
parks, are the only things that are still intact… [ I wouldn't
dare forget to mention our recent trip to the woods near the
lake… it was awesome!! something that we'll all cherish for
life…] I just hope we have more and more and such
moments… moments that i will cherish for life… moments.. that
"we" will cherish for life…
</p>

<p>
<b>Update</b>: I just saw Ringo's old cd of Illayaraja songs… and
 realised, I forgot to mention the wonderful time we
 [Ringo,9,Hari,UC n me..] had listening to them in Ringo's room on
 a CD player… and Ringo's mouthorgan!!!

A couple of days back.. one guy called green<sub>mamba</sub> asked me.. "Why
do you use Linux (GNU/Linux) and not Windows? What is it that
makes LinuxGNU/Linux] so special for you?" I avoided that
question then.. {I was in no mood of answering questions… Exams
had finished just the day before!!}  I am trying to answer it
now… green<sub>mamba</sub> also told me that Roopesh said, "I use it
because I can look at the source code. I am allowed to look at how
things work and fiddle with the way they work!"… I knew it
immediately that this was not the reason for me.[I rarely looked
at source code… and making changes to it.. haha..] So what is
it? I think I can answer this question if I get back to the time
when I started using Linux…[hehe.. not too long ago!! :P]
</p>

<p>
So how did I start using GNU/Linux? How did "we" first meet? It
was during last summer holidays.. that Voods sent me this link
… [I had definitely used GNU/Linux on a few occasions
before… but.. this was when I really began using it…] and
within hours I was a fan of GNU/Linux!![and Richard M Stallman
(RMS)]
</p>

<p>
So its the "philosophy"… The philosophy of Free
Software… [Free as in Freedom, not as in Free Beer…(English is
a wierd wierd Language…)]… The philosophy of Open
Source… that brought me to it… This song says it the best…

now I continue to use it.. for a variety of reasons..[they are NOT
in the order of their priority/importance]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Firstly, using Linux gives me a sense of community… a sense of
oneness [this can't happen with Windows.. because you can't
share stuff… :-(]
</li>
<li>I have begun to hate the concept of Proprietary Software… can
you believe that.. "Sharing stuff..  makes us PIRATES!!"
</li>

<li>I am a growing fan of the Command Line… It simply rocks!!
</li>

<li>There's almost no problem of Viruses/Malware.. You simply don't
need an Anti-Virus..(that needs to be updated every night.. or
u'll have nightmares…)
</li>

<li>Then there's this wonderful concept of Live-CDs.. {specially
Knoppix.. Its absolutely awesome!} It put me(us?) out of
soup… a lotta times…
</li>

<li>The fiddle factor… I have just started to fiddle with
things(…source codes… I added a small feature to my
dc-client Microdc2].. the feature of away messages.. it feels
gr8! :P)
</li>

<li>One of my best friend is using it too! [you know who…]
</li>

<li>The Mascot looks cool!! ;) [I liked the GNU mascot too! (It's on
my side-bar) ]
</li>

<li>The name "LINUX"!! [There's so many flavors(Distros) of
Linux.. that I can keep trying different ones.. all my
life :P.. presently with Slackware!]
</li>

<li>Its Fun!! and I want to use it…
</li>

<li>and finally… Windows sucks! [I don't have to use it… :P]!!
</li>
</ul>

Value your freedom or you will lose it, teaches history. "Don't
bother us with politics," respond those who don't want to learn.

<p>
When you say, "I wrote a program that crashed Windows", people
just stare at you blankly and say, "Hey, I got those with the
system, for free".  –Linus Torvalds
</p>

<p>
"What happens when you read some doc and either it doesn't answer
 your question or is demonstrably wrong? In Linux, you say "Linux
 sucks" and go read the code. In Windows/Oracle/etc you say
 "Windows sucks" and start banging your head against the wall."

<b>Here comes the WikiCamp!!</b>
</p>

<p>
Its all about understanding and harnessing the power of wikis…
</p>

<p>
It aims to bring together the best minds from the Wiki/Internet
space to talk about issues,opportunities,future and evolution of
this powerful tool…
</p>

<p>
Demystifying terms like Collaborative Knowledge Sharing, Wisdom of
Crowds, Crowd Sourcing…
</p>

<p>
To enliven the "Spirit of Sharing"…. [That's what it means to
me!]
</p>

<p>
The event is scheduled for the 25th of February, and the venue is
at Tidel Park, Chennai.
</p>

<p>
Who's the Organiser?? Everyone is. WikiCamp runs as an
unconference, where everyone is an organizer and there is no
passive audience. So it is as much your event.The overall
co-ordination is being done by The Knowledge Foundation, the same
group behind events such as Barcamp Chennai, Blogcamp and
Proto.in.
</p>

<p>
I am a Promoter of this event… You can be one too…. just write
a post in your blog space… and help in telling the world about
it…
</p>

<p>
Wanna Participate?

        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
We are less than a week away from our supposedly dreaded
'test-1'… n i have no clue even about what the syllabus is, in
each course… There's 'Theory of Relativity', of which i'm able
to make no head or tail.. then there's 'Electrical Sciences',
which totally "transformed" my plans for this
sem… then…SPM.. muP.. POM… MT.. C&amp;amp;S………
</p>

<p>
There are loads and loads of other stuff too…
</p>

<p>
Relativity… Emacs…. C++… Python… Table Tennis… learning
a bit of Music… picking up practical electronic
skills… reading a few books…(quite a few actually..).. and so
on…. [not to forget.. attending classes… doing a bit of course
related work…]. The list seems only to be growing everyday…
</p>

<p>
There's nothing that I've crossed out yet.. there's not one thing
that's done to perfection…[with a third of the sem already
through!!] {I already get the feeling.. its "Another sem down the
drain"}
</p>

<p>
But didn't I begin this sem with plans to "rock" it?? Wasn't I
supposed to attend all the classes that I possible can?? What's it
that I've been doing for the past 5-6 weeks?
</p>

<p>
I don't know!! I really can't pinpoint what's been achieved in the
past one month or so… [other than of course quite a considerable
amount of sleep…….]
</p>

<p>
Why are things so horribly out of place?? What's to be done.. to
get on track asap.. I wonder… What should my priorities be? Why
am I being overwhelmed by the things I got to do?
</p>

<p>
I realise this time of my life is as precious as any
other… (probably more…) and i need to make the most of
it…. but what is that "most"?? [It's definitely not sleep!]
</p>

<p class="verse">
I wish to put together,<br>
all my time, energy and matter<br>

<br>
to me, something tangible<br>
definitely seems possible<br>
because nothing is impossible<br>
if there is the quantum of struggle…<br>
<br>
but it must come<br>
before I get back home<br>
needn't create an uproar<br>
but before the end of semsester four<br>
</p>

<p>
[Don't mistake this for a poem… for it is not!! Its just some
scribbling of mine.. which will keep me alive if at the end of
this sem… there's nothing other than this.. which is
tangible… something concrete.. something "see"able]

Hi! I'm a bit late…(courtesy:lightning quick network speeds
@coll…{I started this post a couple of weeks back, at
home… and its been rotting all this while, in my drafts!} ) [Its
already time when the resolutions taken just a couple of weeks
back fade away into oblivion… ] but anyways.. Wish You a Very
Happy gNew Year!! oops.. Happy New Year!
</p>

<p>
Actually this year started of for me not as the usual Happy New
Year.. but as Happy gNew Year! I have been gifted a new PC by my
mom n dad for the new year… and that too an AMD system, (Believe
it or Not..) preloaded with Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4]!
{Its like a fairy tale for me…} Its an AMD Athlon 3200+ with
(512+256)MB RAM and 80GBHDD…. and an awesome 17" TFT Monitor!!
</p>

<p>
I am happy that my resolutions to have a go at the comp… [ and
use it to the best of my abilities to learn about s/w and
h/w…. to try n imbibe in myself the spirit of true hacking…]
haven't yet gone down the drain! { I've already ripped open the
HCL company seal on my box… and opened it up a couple of times
to fiddle with my HDD and RAM… }
</p>

<p>
A couple of days after I got the comp… I tried installing
Debian… and being a NooB doesn't help..(does it?).. I messed up
the X-Server…  After some desperate attempts to get the thing
working.. I gave up……. [I had some ebooks etc. downloaded on
my comp at home, which I wished to dump on my comp]. So I
persisted… I tried FC 6 [Fedora Core] …. everything was fine
until the final step… FC refused to show me the Login screen!!
Finally at 3 am I gave up…. I planned to get the most valuable
stuff onto a CD and set things right, back in the comforts of my
room and the company of Voodoo, but that was not to be….
</p>

<p>
At 10am, (I just woke up then), I find that the comp at home
refuses to turn ON!! I thought it was some petty problem like a
loose contact somewhere, which could be set right easily.. but
after an hour of struggle.. I realise that the problem is
serious.. {The SMPS had blown off} [looks like a Hindi
Movie,doesn't it??]
</p>

<p>
Then began the real fun!! I somehow managed to connect the old
hard disk to the new Mother Board…[my new cabinet is quite
small… I now realize that I placed the HDD in quite a precarious
position…].. but there was no OS on either HDD… [the "Windows"
on the old one…. din't open… they felt awkward in their new
environs… ;-) ] I would have returned back to coll without any
of my stuff.. but for Knoppix (live) … it saved the day for me!!
Finally I managed to dump my stuff onto the new HDD… [All 's
well that ends well!! :-)] Now I've got both the Linux distro's
[Debian and FC-6] along with all the stuff I collected at home! [
Thanks to V00d00!! ] along with a little confidence that I am not
too bad at handling H/W!
</p>

<p>
When I look back at this whole episode… It feels as if nature
had conspired…. to keep this one resolution of mine ALIVE…. to
ignite in me the fire of "the spirit of true hacking"… [ I hope
that I play my part well.. (nature played its brilliantly…) and
pick up a zillionth part of the commitment ( and dedication to
hacking) of the Hackers from the Hacker Land!! ]
</p>

<p>
Here's a pic of one of the very few cool things I could get my
comp to do….. [ I accessed the Remote Desktop Server on my own
system…..]

                <a href="/posts/aweful-science.html">Awe[ful] @ Science !!?!??!</a>
        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
I was at the B.M Birla Science Musuem yesterday… it was calm
with no one in there.. the only people i could see were the
sweepers and cleaners.. the place was dull and lifeless… I dint
like it.. but slowly.. as the afternoon progressed.. people
started coming in and by 5 in the evening.. there were quite a few
in. The museum seemed to have sprung to life suddenly… there was
a lot of action all around with people enjoying in ( and trying to
understand) the wonderful world of science….
</p>

<p>
A lot of kids had come along with their parents… to dive into
the world of science… they were enjoying it… the parents also
turned into kids and were having great fun… it was a great
sight… the parents tried their best to demistify the
happenings… those with a science background did it from thier
knowledge.. the others patiently went through the explanations…
</p>

<p>
The kids were thoroughly enjoying it… I don't know if they would
later on in life remember what they learnt now… but definitely a
love for science and physics will be ignited in their hearts, it
will fill their consciousness… the spirit of curiosity will have
multiplied manifold… even the elders..connected with the child
somewhere deep within themselves… they too enjoyed the wonders
of the world of science…[and ofcourse the company and thrill in
the eyes of their kids..] I too enjoyed the experience… the
experiments and the thrill of the others brought a smile to my
face too…. but it set me thinking…
</p>

<p>
If science can inspire so much awe.. what's happening at our
engineering colleges? When people have the chance to learn a whole
lot of science and put it to practical use… why isn't it that
they are excited about it? Why is it that people just endup
mugging a few formulae just before exams and get over with it?
Where's the problem? Where is that curiosity, all of us had as a
child, lost?
</p>

<p>
I can recollect, in the last sem while doing experiments in the MT
lab there wasn't even a tenth of the awe or joy… that i could
see and feel at the museum… why?? Is it that the child within
us.. [the future engineers] dead? { If that's true.. then the
country is in deep trouble..} But I don't think that's true… I
enjoyed my visit to the museum totally…and I am sure every other
'to be engineer' would have too.. then where's the trouble?
</p>

<p>
I don't know exactly… but I wonder if its because everything is
equated to marks and grades… all that matters to an engineering
student [and the world around him/her..] is his/her CG or
%age… Is this what the country needs? Were the 'temples of
Learning'- the IIT's and a whole lot of other technical
institutions set-up for this very pupose? Of what use are those
engineers to the country, who aren't in awe of science and
engineering, whose spirit of curiosity has been overpowered and
suppressed by the present education system?
</p>

<p>
Isn't it time we have a closer look at our education system… why
are we still sticking to the 'British sytem' introduced during a
colonial rule.. to break the back bone of our nation… to supress
our ability to think rationally.. to produce third rate clerks to
work for them at lower wages? Why is the emphasis on marks and
grades growing exponentially? Shouldn't we start working to cut
this growth at its root? Is this sytem good enough to produce
"real" engineers, doctors, lawyers, journos, CA's, architects,
designers, writers, artists etc etc..
</p>

<p>
Where have all the gurukuls of the ancient past and the
Santiniketans of the recent past gone? Isn't the country in
desparate need of more of these 'temples of learning'??
</p>

        <div class="post"> <p>
Just finished the 'Test-2'. Here's the first
post that can genuinely be called "mine"…
</p>

<p>
With my last minute 'C2S' plans [Co-operate to Survive… does it
ring any bells??] failing to work, the tests did their job,cleaned
me up [both literally and metaphorically]. Though I didn't learn
much while preparing for the tests, the syllabus gave me a brain
wave (surprised to find that my Brain is still ticking…. after
more than one year of Engg.) : Build my first Computer game!!
[Don't expect too much from it… I'm a novice at programming and
my game doesn't even have a GUI as of now!]
</p>

<p>
I had been doing a l'l bit of C programming off late but, I never
learnt 'file management' until the "Test-2" forced me to, and
Viola! I embarked on a self assigned, "Project - Hangman".
</p>

<p>
Here's a peek at the game… [after a lot of
testing and debugging (the use of technical terms is just a matter
of "phantee")]
</p>

<p>
"Phantee"- a typical hyderabadi term; has no literal english
translation; refers to "concealing ignorance in style" ??
</p>

<p>
The basics were quite simple and were done in
two hours… but then began the real test! The program needed a
lot of improvements to make it "Playable" but, the tests were less
than a week away.
</p>

<p>
I managed to find enough time even during the
tests (it doesn't really matter whether you spend a week, a day or
just an hour mugging - you are bound to be cleaned up!), and
finished most of the stuff within a week.
</p>

<p>
There were quite a few road blocks which I had to get
around. Amongst other things, obtaining a 'decent' database of
words was one. Initially, I wrote another program for building up
a dbase of your own. This wasn't good enough…. so, with some
ideas from Arunodai, I successfully integrated a dbase of 14000
words [picked it from another version of hangman] with my own
version. After one whole week of debugging and improving {with an
annoying disturbance called 'Test-2'}, now my game is quite
'playable' (i.e it can be played by people other than me).
</p>

<p>
So you might say, "what's the big-deal about writing a simple
program of about hundred lines, that can randomly display words
and check if you guess it right within seven turns?". This l'll
project of mine may seem like a Pro'jest' to many! [writing a
complex code, messing it up, debugging it for one whole week, etc
just for the sake of creating a simple game, that can be played if
you have a friend,a pen and a paper. Doing so much&lt;span
class="text"&gt; for a game, that already has 'n' version,
seems very foolish and a collosal waste
of time and effort. Doesn't it??] Obviously, that's not a great
achievement, its not something thats worth a mention in the
Guiness Book of World Records or something. But it taught me a lot
of stuff, stuff that you can't learn from books,stuff that you
can't learn by mugging [I wonder if you can learn anything under
the sun by "Mugging"], stuff that you can only learn by
experience.I learnt a lot more of Computer Programming through
this project, than I learnt through two, '3-point' courses!! {Of
course, I wouldn't have even dreamt of doing such a thing, if not
for these two courses, that introduced me to programming and
taught me the essentials}. Can't such projects make the other
courses a joy too?
</p>

<p>
This brings me to our recent TRW [Technical Report Writing]
project. You might wonder what kind of projects could be given in
this kind of a course. We were asked to write a report on 'Waste
Management' in our college, and to include some suggestions on the
ways to improve it. Though this was an interesting job, with scope
for some field activity and other such stuff, we [a group of six
members] successfully turned the 'project' into a Pro'jest'!!
[that's my personal view; the others in the group may
disagree].But still, we learnt a lot on Report writing. A lot more
than what we learnt by reading pages and pages of instructions, on
the techniques of writing good reports,by the so called experts.
</p>

<p>
Both the projects helped me understand stuff better and to put
them to use. Why can't all courses have little projects, along
with the routine stuff? Will it not improve my understanding of
the subject matter? Will I not learn a great deal of things more
than I do by mugging things up, just a week before the tests? Will
it not be an experience, a lesson, of its own??
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I see and I forget.
I hear and I remember.
I do and I understand.
–A Chinese Proverb.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I wonder if my "Engineering", will ever be a joy for me?
</p>

<p>
I am looking forward to more Projects… to make engineering a joy
for me!! [it doesn't matter even if they're self-assigned ;-) ]

<p>
On April Fools Day of 1998, hackers broke into the MIT web server
and changed the MIT home page to indicate that The Walt Disney
Company had purchased MIT for $6.9 billion.
</p>

<p>
The hacked page contained a link fake to a press release titled
<i>Walt Disney Corporation to Acquire MIT for $6.9 Billion</i>.
</p>

<p>
Later that day the MIT News Office issued a press release titled
<i>MIT says "Disney buys MIT" hack revealed by low price</i>

Hello,

One late rainy night I had an idea. There is a hill on IL route 29
in Peoria IL, that people climb and write a small message across
this hill for everyone to view from a far. What would be better
than spreading my two most favorite words across this hill. So we
set out with a little over 200 garbage bags and nearly 400
nails. 12:30am and rainy so you can figure that a hill of that
size is going to be slippery (lol) nearly falling down hill with
every step we start building each letter. At around 2:30am we have
finished and now the sun will rise over a hill which spreads the
words Free Software to every person that passes by. This is by far
a vary small non-complex hack but I beleve it is a hack in it
self. This is a tribute to Free Software [and the GNU Project].

Happy Hacking
