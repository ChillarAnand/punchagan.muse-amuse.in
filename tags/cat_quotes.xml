&lt;li&gt;I wanted to change the world. But I have found that the only thing
one can be sure of changing is oneself. ~ Aldous Huxley
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The true voyage of discovery consists not of going to new places,
but of having a new pair of eyes. — Marcel Proust (1871–1922)

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep
  fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course,
the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we
began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really
were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these
machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching
them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I
hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I
hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible
salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about
computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to successful
computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is
intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first
led up to it, that you can make it more." – &lt;i&gt;Alan J. Perlis (April 1,
1922-February 7, 1990)&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Forgetting is like radiation: you cannot smell it, you cannot taste it, and
  when you finally notice the damage, it is already irreversible – &lt;i&gt;Piotr
Wozniack&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;"Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes" – &lt;i&gt;Edsger Dijkstra&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;“My idea of dominating is that I get all of the players on my team

&lt;li&gt;“It is a risk to love. What if it doesn't work out? Ah, but what if

&lt;li&gt;"Satisfaction of one's curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life." – Linus Pauling
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;"Silence is the language of god. All else is poor translation." ~Rumi
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart
  will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make
sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not
even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little
luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or
coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket — safe, dark,
motionless, airless — it will change. It will not be broken; it will
become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to
tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only
place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the
dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.” – &lt;i&gt;C. S. Lewis&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care – not just
  of any great method that descends from the heavens. That these acts
are simple doesn't mean that they are simplistic; and it hardly
means that they are easy. They are nonetheless the fabric of
greatness and, more so, of beauty in any human endeavor. To ignore
them is not yet to be fully human.  – James O. Coplien, &lt;i&gt;Foreword
to Clean Code&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;“We are all in the same boat, in a stormy sea, and we owe each other
a terrible loyalty.” – G.K. Chesterton
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The road to wisdom? – Well, it's plain and simple to express:

&lt;p&gt;
Err
and err
and err again
but less
and less
and less.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
– Piet Hein (Grooks)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first
  place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you
are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it." –Brian Kernighan
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;“Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats

&lt;li&gt;Scientists study the world as it is; engineers create the world that
has never been. – &lt;i&gt;Theodore von Karman&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you can love someone with your whole heart, even one person, then

&lt;li&gt;In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is
then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We

spirit.  – &lt;i&gt;Albert Schweitzer, 1875 - 1965&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
Where the mind is without fear and the head held high;&lt;br&gt;
Where knowledge is free;&lt;br&gt;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;&lt;br&gt;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;&lt;br&gt;

Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action;&lt;br&gt;
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The true Enlightenment thinker, the true rationalist, never wants to
talk anyone into anything. No, he does not even want to convince;
all the time he is aware that he may be wrong. Above all, he values
the intellectual independence of others too highly to want to
convince them in important matters. He would much rather invite
contradiction, preferably in the form of rational and disciplined
criticism. He seeks not to convince but to arouse — to challenge
others to form free opinions. – &lt;i&gt;Karl Popper – On Freedom&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet,
balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take
orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze
