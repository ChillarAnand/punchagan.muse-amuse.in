<li>I spent the whole of yesterday just working on the LED-bot.
</li>
<li>Spent some time cleaning up meta-stuff about the project, making it a real
package, adding a setup.py, added LICENSE &amp; AUTHOR files, etc.
</li>
<li>I found it really frustrating that there's no good/standard way to remove
duplication of information between pip's <code>requirements.txt</code> and
<code>install_requires</code>
</li>
<li>We got the bot running on the Beagle Bone, but it turned out to be too slow.
After some playing around with trying to get rid of Python for-loops, I was
able to use PIL's <code>image.tobytes</code> and some image cropping to get the data to
be sent to the LEDs, and it sped up the display quite a bit.

<li>I spent the morning cleaning up the "repr" functions of the diff classes, so
that the diff of functions between two modules can be printed out in a
somewhat meaningful way.

<li>I spent most of the afternoon, preparing to make a small presentation on how
<code>sys.path</code> works in Python.  I thought I didn't do as good a job of it, as I
would've liked, but Tom thought it was not too bad…
</li>

<li>Looks like another of those days, where I didn't get much done…  I spent
the evening finishing off <a href="http://craphound.com/homeland/">Homeland</a>. It's a brilliant book, and everyone who
cares about the Government and policies and technology MUST read it!  Thanks

<li>I feel like I didn't get much done yesterday.
</li>
<li>I mostly worked on the API differ, but didn't get much done.  I have a few
tests, and some code for diffing two functions, but I'm not very happy with
it.
</li>
<li>I helped Giorgio and Carlos with using my client only <code>hs_oauth</code>
  script/library, for their Zulip bot.
</li>
<li>The white boarding group worked on some binary related problems, and it was
fun.
</li>
<li>I looked at how the HS OAuth backend works on blaggregator and thought about
how to go about fixing the issue of broken images on the site.  The problem
happens because the image URLs are returned from the HS API calls, that are
made whenever a user logs in(?), and the URLs are cached.  Since, HS uses
cloudfront for its assets, the URLs expire after a period of time, and the
cached urls in blag's database need to be updated.  There could be two ways
of doing it -
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Check if the URL 404s, every time a URL is requested, on the server side.
</li>
<li>Do it on the client side, with some javascript magic.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Intuitively, I feel like 2. would be better, but Madhu suggested
that 1. wouldn't be that bad either.  We could try both out, and see which
works better I suppose.
</p>

<p>
I'd be interested to try this out, sometime.

<li>I decided to work on Pankaj's idea to write a tool that gives you API
differences between two versions of a library.  It would be useful to have
the list of public API changes in a library you use, to estimate the cost of
updating to the newer version, without having to manually go through all the
changes.
