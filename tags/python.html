After some playing around with trying to get rid of Python for-loops, I was
able to use PIL's <code>image.tobytes</code> and some image cropping to get the data to
be sent to the LEDs, and it sped up the display quite a bit.

<li>I feel like I didn't get much done yesterday.
</li>
<li>I mostly worked on the API differ, but didn't get much done.  I have a few
tests, and some code for diffing two functions, but I'm not very happy with
it.
</li>
<li>I helped Giorgio and Carlos with using my client only <code>hs_oauth</code>
script/library, for their Zulip bot.
</li>
<li>The white boarding group worked on some binary related problems, and it was
fun.
</li>
<li>I looked at how the HS OAuth backend works on blaggregator and thought about
how to go about fixing the issue of broken images on the site.  The problem
happens because the image URLs are returned from the HS API calls, that are
made whenever a user logs in(?), and the URLs are cached.  Since, HS uses
cloudfront for its assets, the URLs expire after a period of time, and the
cached urls in blag's database need to be updated.  There could be two ways
of doing it -
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Check if the URL 404s, every time a URL is requested, on the server side.
</li>
<li>Do it on the client side, with some javascript magic.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Intuitively, I feel like 2. would be better, but Madhu suggested
that 1. wouldn't be that bad either.  We could try both out, and see which
works better I suppose.

<p>
I'd be interested to try this out, sometime.

studying it.  I'm not sure how I feel about it, but we got to display fancy
stuff.
</li>
<li>I wasn't feeling like working on any of my 'old'/'ongoing' projects, and
since Mondays don't feel very productive, I worked on writing a couple of
simple scripts to create twitter lists of HSers, batch wise.

<p>
For the HS API, I just reused some old code I had lying around from my
experiments with the OAuth2 API, though I had to tweak it a little bit to be
able to actually login, using requests. Something about CSRF tokens seems to
have changed.
</p>

<p>
In the process, I found that twitter's API isn't very pleasant to use.  Or
may be it's the fact that I was using python twitter client without getting
my own client id/key, but the whole experience of dealing with the twitter
API wasn't a pleasant one at all!
</p>
</li>
<li>Amber, Daria and I also spent about an hour white-boarding some problems from
the Cracking the Code Interview book.
</li>
<li>I ended up fixing some minor issues with blaggregator and am hoping that the
long pending PR will be merged today.

<li>I spent the Saturday revamping my Emacs config.  The main issue with my
config was having a "package" list, of all the packages that the
configuration uses, in case we are trying to duplicate it elsewhere.  I
noticed that this gets out of sync, because I install packages by hand and
never update this list.  I wrote up <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/user-lisp/setup-defuns.el">some code</a>, that keeps this list in sync
with all the packages I have installed.  I configured el-get to play well
with my config, and am pretty happy with my setup, though I still have to add
some matching/searching features with helm/ido/whatever else.

<li>The TTS part is more or less working right now, the next step would be to
deploy it on the RaspberryPi and start using it as a radio, to see what my
needs are like. Hooking it up to <a href="https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client">Jasper client</a> seems like a good idea,
right now… though I'm not sure if it would work very well, with the pi's
audio output drowning out the voice commands.

coffee with her, and I chatted with her briefly. She encouraged me to try and
send a patch to CPython, that involved debugging and fixing some C issues.

<li>I spent some time with Tom, while he tried to get <code>cinspect</code> working for him,
and it seemed like having the developer next to you, helped.  As always.  We
didn't make any fixes to the code, but it worked.

<li>I spent the afternoon, adding tests for a simple issue, to see how patches are sent.
</li>
<li>Later, I paired with Sophia for an hour to refactor the vcs code. It's
beginning to look much better than what it used to, and I like that.

<li>Jessica's talk on buffer overflows was enlightening and entertaining. It was
very similar to a talk that Max gave on one of the thursdays, but it was
exciting nevertheless.
</li>
<li>After the talk, I am inspired to try and work through the Hacking: Art of

<li>It turned out that the SPI driver exposed a faster way to write bits, writing
to all the LEDs at once, instead of one at a time, and this was sufficient to
get things working!
</li>

<li>Kyle and I started to have enough, of the glowing LEDs and decided to wrap up
the project, but, Nick had different ideas for us! We had talked about having
the music stream via airplay, but Nick got his DJing tools, and it would be
too bad to not use it for the party, but doing that meant Airplay's delay
wouldn't help the DJ. So, we connected a line-in, and thought we'd be done if
we just read the input and used that data. But, it turns out that's not so
simple because sending data over the wire, added noise to it, and in a whole
range of frequencies! I tried removing all the fourier coefficients which
were lower than a threshold, but I felt like it didn't work very well, until
Nick reduced the gain of this output on the amp to the very minimum. Finally,
Kyle and I decided that this was good enough for the party!
</li>

<li>I also hacked up a quick script to read a font file, and use the grey values
to get ascii characters to show up on the LED strip.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mel's talk in the morning was brilliant!  I wonder why it's not a part of
recommended reading for Hacker Schoolers, or referred to, in the manual.
</li>
<li>Logically, it makes sense that Mel came now, so that she didn't have to come
twice to talk to the firsts and seconds, but it would have been great to have
had this talk in the first week of Hacker School!
</li>
<li>Mel gave us a lot of new information and insights into education and learning
styles. I also like the fact that she gave us all a good vocabulary to think
about and discuss stuff related to learning. I will try to think, and apply
as much of this as I can, for the rest of my time here.
</li>
<li>She talked about <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2014/02/10/test-driven-learning-setting-learning-goals-for-yourself-software-engineering-edition/">test driven learning</a> which seemed very interesting. Instead
of just saying, "wow that would be an interesting thing to do", stop for a
moment, think about what you are trying to learn, and how you will assess if
you have learnt what you wanted to, and then dive into the project.
</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html">learning styles</a> workshop was pretty good too, though I feel like I don't
know myself well enough, and I unable to properly "bucket" myself.  Later, I
took a <a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html">quiz</a>, and ended up fairly close to the middle, in all the dimensions.
</li>
<li>Mel introduced us to the idea of <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/201816780/A-Cognitive-Apprenticeship-Primer">cognitive apprenticeship</a>, and encouraged us
to try out the different modes when pairing. I really liked the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development">Zone
of proximal development</a> and I will try to take the advice of spending most of
the rest of my time here in this zone.
</li>
<li>Do I (really) care?  Motivation and mindset, …
</li>
<li>Be courageous!

<h2 id="sec-2">Airplay and Raspberry Pi</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I was trying to wrap libshairport and use it on the RPi to be able to listen
to songs being streamed on Airplay, and use that data to drive the LEDs.
</li>
<li>Shairport, a tool written in C seemed to work.  My attempts to wrap
<code>libshairport</code>, which is a fork of <code>shairport</code> converting it into a library,
failed miserably.
</li>
<li>The trouble was essentially getting Airplay to discover my service.  I tried
a bunch of things with <code>pybonjour</code> and <code>avahi</code>, but wasn't able to get it
right.
</li>
<li>Finally, I tried just announcing the service with <code>shairport</code>, and actually
running a python script that wraps <code>libshairport</code> to listen to the data.
But, this didn't work and iTunes complained that this Airplay device is not
compatible. Before going much further with this, I found <code>shairplay</code> which is
a tool similar to <code>shairport</code>, but came with a library, and also Python
bindings!  I happily used this to get stuff working!

<li>It was exciting to have so many new Hacker Schoolers in the space.  But, the
excitement was kinda distracting too.
</li>

<li>I spent most of the day looking at shairport, and libshairport and trying to
wrap it, so I can use it to get data for the spectrum analyzer via the
Air-play protocol.  I was able to call it using <code>ctypes</code>, but it doesn't seem
discoverable.
</li>

<li>I also briefly looked at Julia and <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org">dwm</a>, to try and port dwm to Julia.  It
doesn't seem like too much work, but is going to take me a while given how
comfortable I'm with both Julia and C.
</li>

<li>Yaron Minsky's talk on distributed systems was a great introduction to
Distributed systems.
</li>

<li>After the talk, I spent a little time updating my notes from an old org-mode
workshop to present it at the emacs user group meet up today.

<li>During the weekend, I had this idea of building a personalized "radio" for
myself using a Raspberry pi.  The idea is to have a service where all my
bookmarks, and feeds are accumulated to, instead of eating up valuable
browser tab real estate.  And then, I could use a Raspberry pi to randomly
play content off of it, based on a theme.
</li>

<li>I worked on getting things together for it, during the weekend.  The project
is more like a "thing that needs to be done", rather than something that puts
me out of my comfort zone, atleast as far as I can see. So, I'm just going to
work on it as a background thing, between other projects, etc.
</li>

<li>Festival seemed OK initially, while I was trying things out, but when I
actually used it to read me a blog post, it was really terrible!  I tried
demos of a few commercial tools, and they seem much better than what festival
had to offer.  I wonder what it would take to get Festival, up there.  I
tried using Google's translate service's tts (unofficial API) and it seemed
so good!  But, it limits each request to 100 bytes, and the audio will have
to be downloaded via the Network.
</li>

<li>Madhu pointed me to MaryTTS, which seemed to be an active project and it
seemed to be much better than Festival, though not as good as Google's tts.
I'm going to try getting it to run on a Pi, next.

around with the Pi, for the past week-ish, and it has been fun!  Kyle and I
will probably work more on tweaking it, to get it to work the way we want
it, for the party!
</li>

<li>I also did a little bit of Julia with Sean, and it was fun.  I may try
playing around with it, a little bit, but not sure what to work on.  May be
continue working through the think-complexity book using Julia?
</li>

<li>Or jump into something I totally don't know about, inspired by listening to
Julia Evans' podcast for Ruby Rogues.  I just got this idea of trying to
write a window manager to understand how X works, and what wayland is…  I
could try porting dwm or i3wm to Julia.

<li>Kyle and I did a demo of our spectrum analyzer/visualizer during the
presenations.  It was fun to work on, though we mostly just followed a
tutorial on the web, and made use of a bunch of libraries.
</li>
<li>I spent the night in HackerSchool.
</li>
<li>I was cleaning up the code in the tutorial we were trying to follow.
</li>
<li>Also, cleaned up the install.sh used by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/togiles/lightshowpi/src">lightshowpi</a> project to not do all the
ugly sudo setups, and use a Python virtualenv and install into that.
</li>
<li>Refactored the ugly looking music part of the tutorial into a smaller script
with only the functionality that we were going to use.
</li>
<li>We hit an interesting bug that would light up all the LEDs on the strip, once
in a while.  I didn't notice it during the night, because I had a "decay"
factor (the max factor by which the height of the columns should get reduced
between successive updates) was 0.9, but when the decay factor was reduced to
a lower value, it would happen quite often.  Also, we didn't see this
happening before.  So, we thought the bug was in the code I had written, when
I should have been sleeping. After reading and debugging my code for a bit,
with Kyle and Sean, I thought it was something hardware related that we were
doing wrong.  But, it turns out that a library we were using lit-up the whole
strip, when start and end values were both zero, instead of not lighting up
anything!
</li>
<li>Also, we hit another off-by one error, just before the demo. I didn't do the
math for splitting the strip into columns too carefully, and we hadn't
noticed the off-by one error until we taped up the strip into different
columns on a pillar for demo.
</li>
<li>There were some cool presentations by others.  I'll update the list on
Monday, since I currently don't remember them all!  Looking at the list of
names on the registration sheet would help!

<li>I didn't spend much time at Hacker School on Friday.  I reached a bit late
for the start of "Recursion day", and did a few problems.  The problems were
simple, but interesting.  After lunch, I headed home to start to Philly.
</li>
<li>Later in the day, I did some refactoring of the code to have the index reader
and writer split out.

<li>I also added a setup.py to be able to install the package using the standard
tools instead of PYTHONPATH hacks and stuff.

<li>During the refactoring, I again hit <i>this bug</i>.  I found out from Pankaj that
he has <code>from __future__ import print_function, absolute_imports</code> at the start
of his files these days.  I think I'm going to do it, too.

<li>Unicode issues: it turned out that (atleast) one of the files had a character
that wasn't UTF-8 encoded. I got around it by trying 'utf-8', if not falling
back to 'iso-8859-1'.  Now that I think about it, I should fallback to
'utf-8' with replace, if that doesn't work either.

<li>I did a little clean up on the way the indexes were stored, to be able to
have a <code>getfile</code>, to mimic <code>inspect</code>'s API.

<li>I also "improved" the IPython startup script to monkey-patch the source code
formatter/colorizer to not break with C modules.

<li>As preparation for a one-on-one this week with one of the facilitators, I was
wondering if I was really getting better as a programmer, by doing what I am
doing.
</li>
<li>I have heard at numerous places that reading and reflection are keys to
getting better. I feel like I haven't been giving these things much attention
in the past couple of weeks. I don't catch up on reading all the awesome
reading material shared on Zulip and I switched from writing this blog post
first thing in the morning, to any-time-after-lunch. I don't think this
worked out very well. Writing the post worked as a way to reflect on what I
had done yesterday, and what I should be doing today. So, I am back to
writing the blog post, first thing in the morning!
</li>
<li>Yesterday, I worked on indexing the Python sources in a way that the
inspection code can look up, later.  During this process, I found that my
code to use libclang's AST wasn't generic enough, and I had to clean it up to
be able to extract useful information from any file in the <code>cpython</code> sources.
</li>
<li>We also got to attend a super-awesome talk by <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Labnik</a>! He talked about
his progression from being an application developer, to writing libraries, to
working on languages (as a professional developer). He made a lot of
interesting and inspiring points during his talk.  Some of those that stuck
with me are:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>None of these is particularly harder than any of the other. Depending on
each person's personality, or the way their brain works, they are good at
doing one or the other.
</li>
<li>Getting good at programming is a matter of showing up, more than about the
"genes".  He repeated quite a few times that he disliked the idea of "baby
hacker", and left out the story of his childhood and college programming
days! I'm totally stealing his idea of meeting every saturday at 1pm, with
a bunch of friends and working until it was 10pm or so, when they could get
cheap beer and food!  And he did this all through his college!  It is
interesting that this idea is so similar to Hacker School!

It was a very enjoyable and inspiring talk on the whole.

<li>The plan for today is to actually have the parsed information dumped into
some persistent format, and modify the inspect code to actually use it.

I took it easy during the weekend, and went on a nice camp with my a cousin's
family to TobyHanna State Park for a day or so, and spent the remaining (long)
weekend at their place in PA.  It was a pretty nice break!
</p>

<p>
Yesterday evening, I talked to Madhu about how ugly my code looked while I was
trying to use <code>libclang</code>, and he told me that he found a lot of wrapped C++/C
libraries end up being that way, and I also realized that using the Python AST
library seemed much cleaner, because it just contained Python objects, but
representing C/C++ objects in an AST and interacting with them in Python, isn't
that clean.
</p>

<p>
I cleaned up my code, and removed all the ugly regexes to use libclang to do
the parsing of the libs, and get the source code.  I basically got all the
tests passing, but they were taking an order of magnitude longer to run.  So, I
guess the next step is to cache things somehow.
</p>

<p>
I also added support for viewing the sources of built-in types.  It was pretty
simple, once I had everything working with libclang.

<li>I got distracted trying to add a hack to Hacker School's <a href="https://github.com/sursh/blaggregator">blaggregator</a>, to
enable posting to different channels on zulip.
</li>
<li>I learnt a few things about Django.  Commented out references to views that
don't exists breaks templating.  Formsets didn't seem very convenient to use,
for editing data showing the user only partial forms.
</li>
<li>I played around with Clang for a bit, to try and use libclang to parse the C
code for inspection, instead of writing one myself.  It sometimes feels like
an overkill, but it feels like it'll make the whole code more robust.  I'm
not sure.  I'll need to play around for a bit more to decide.
</li>
<li>I also finally got around to fix the resolution of my tty shells.  I was in a
bus, and wanted my laptop's battery to last longer, and decided to use a tty
shell with just emacs running. But, the resolution sucked.  So, I
fixed. Essentially it involved removing a blacklist file that an old version
of Nvidia drivers left behind in
<code>/usr/share/grub-gfxpayload-lists/blacklist/</code> and setting
<code>GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080</code> in <code>/etc/default/grub</code>.
</li>
<li>Later in the evening I also bought the domain <code>octo.cat</code>, given there were a
bunch of people buying cat domains, and talking about it on Zulip!

exercise, and I built one that is not persistent, in the two hours.  I worked
on a not so important problem of having sorted query parameters, instead of
the more important problem of having a persistent server.  Anyway, I should
be building something that works, first, before trying to solve the more
interesting problems.  At least on Fridays.

StringIO in the cStringIO module in Python 2.7.2 doesn't handle
unicode strings properly.  This bug has bitten me on a couple of
occasions, in the recent past.

Just making a note for myself:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use StringIO if speed doesn't matter so much.
</li>
<li>Whenever possible, just convert the input to StringIO to a
string, if what you are doing doesn't really require unicode
strings.

Or may be it's just time to move up to Python 2.7.3

PyCon is back to Bangalore for the 4th edition.  I've been to all
the previous three editions, and I'm looking forward to this one.
</p>

<p>
I haven't spoken at any of the previous editions, and hadn't
even really considered speaking at the previous editions.
But, this time, I proposed a couple of talks, and both of them
have been accepted! Woot! Lots of work ahead of me, but I'm
really looking forward to give good talks.  I'll be talking
about Enaml, and showing a brief demo of all the wonderful
things it makes possible.  In the other talk, I'll give a
brief overview of the latest happenings in the SciPy community
and the projects to look forward to and contribute to.  Pankaj
and I will be talking together on this.
</p>


<p>
Also, Kenneth (lawgon) will be deeply missed at this edition
of PyCon.

<p>
Sadly, John Hunter, the lead author of matplotlib, also passed
away last week.  RIP. :(

Pankaj and I were stuck with this weird bug recently.  We had
a class <code>A</code> and a subclass <code>B</code> and an instance of B, b, was
returning False for <code>isinstance(b, A)</code>.
</p>

<p>
After some debugging, we found that it was a problem with
imports, and the same module was being imported twice, using
two different names – <code>bar</code> and <code>baz.bar</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here's a cooked-up example to demonstrate the "bug".  We
create a package baz, as shown below.
</p>


<pre class="example">
$ tree baz
baz
├── bar.py
├── foo.py
└── __init__.py
</pre>

<p>
We have our two classes, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> defined in the <code>bar</code>
module.

    <span class="n">pass</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
We run <code>foo.py</code> and scratch our heads for a while, before
figuring out what's wrong…
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp"># We add the directory containing out package 'baz' to sys.path to be</span>

        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
Well, as you can see, I've changed my blog a bit.  I had been
trying to make it gel well with org-mode and looking for ways to
allow me to share arbit stuff with separate feeds for tags,
separate pages with independent feeds, etc.
</p>

<p>
I finally got around to tweaking the code of reprise to be able to
do this.  There are still a few things I would like to change, but
I'll make the changes gradually.  The looks are also straight from
uddigal's reprise, with a few tiny tweaks.  I hope it is alright
to be using it.  I really liked the theme.
</p>

<p>
Every tag now has a separate feed. <code>/tags/emacs.atom</code> will give
you the feed of <code>emacs</code> for instance. Also, I plan to have a
couple of more pages, one for all the interesting links I come
across and another for interesting quotes.  Both of these pages,
have their own feeds too (<code>quotes.atom</code> and <code>links.atom</code>).
</p>

<p>
In the spirit of minimalism, I got rid of comments.  I've been
looking for ways of having comments without all the javascript
cruft from disqus, but I didn't find any satisfactory way to do
this.  So, the site will have no comments.  You can write to me,
in case you've something to say to me.
</p>

<p>
Adios.

I gave a short talk titled, <i>Pictures, Songs and Python</i> in this
year's edition of SciPy India.  The talk was a beginner level
talk, mainly intended to get newbies excited about Python.  My
motive was to impress upon the audience that Python is a language
to help you think in. It's a good playing ground to experiment
with your ideas, quickly prototype ideas and have fun!  To my
surprise, the talk was liked by quite a few people.  Thanks to
Prof. Jayant Kirtane for the Bournville!

                <a href="/posts/do-our-eyes-suck-at-blue.html">Do our eyes suck at blue?</a>
        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
This is some fun I had, trying to replicate what was written in
this post. I had been trying to understand what was happening
here, and found this post on Hacker News very helpful.
</p>

<p>
It is a known fact that our eyes have more cones for green and
red as compared to blue.  The Bayer filter used for digital camera
lenses is based upon this principle.  This post tries to
illustrate that using the following two arguments.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Looking at only the blue channel of an image looks very dark.
</li>
<li>Tripling the pixel size of blue channel doesn't cause much
distortion in the final image.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hence, our eyes suck at blue.
</p>

<p>
Their argument is flawed, but we could try and improve a few
things.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Looking at the blue channel.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This is definitely flawed, since the intensity of blue in the
image they have taken may be less and hence giving us a false
positive.
</p>

<p>
We could instead gray-scale the image and use these pixel values
in the 3 channels and look at the images.
</p>

<p>
This also eliminates the problem of the image being captured
through a Bayer filter.
</p>

<p>
Here's some <code>python</code> code to do the same. (uses <code>matplotlib</code>)

Again, there was this argument of use of Bayer filter affecting
the image and the like.
</p>

<p>
What I did was to swap the channels, and then look at the
images. However I swapped the channels, the image where the
green channel was pixelated always looked the worst.  The
difference between blue and red was less noticeable, I feel.

It basically checks for open windows of a program and brings them
to the foreground or starts the program. I use it for my 3 most

If you are new to <code>Python</code>, you should probably stop reading here.

The "same thing", in a slightly different way.

<p>
Both the code blocks, look really the same, until you look carefully.
Under normal circumstances <code>a = a + b</code> and <code>a += b</code> behave exactly
similarly, and we really don't need to bother about the differences
between them.
</p>

<p>
But, <code>+=</code>, which is an augmented assignment operator, actually tries
to perform the operation in-place, unlike the other statement where
<code>+</code> actually returns a new object which is again being referenced by
the name <code>a</code>.
</p>

<p>
But, when dealing with <code>numpy</code> arrays, this will lead to trouble.
When assigning to an array, it's <code>dtype</code> is not changed and hence the
trouble.
</p>

<p>
The right way to use the augmented assignment operator, would be:

Just back after attending PyCon India '10. It was not as exciting
as I hoped it would be.  That's generally the case with any
conference I attend.  (I guess, I expect too much from them. :P)
</p>

<p>
The keynote by David Goodger (pronounced like Badger :) was
"Good".  It was a very simple one talking of how to get Python
into the workplace.  His simple recommendation was to use Python
if we saw any opportunity where it could be used, without
bothering about permissions, convincing people etc.  "It's better
to ask for forgiveness, than for permission."  He spoke of myths
around Python – scripting language, dynamic language, too much
white space, toy language, nobody uses it.  He concluded the talk,
by saying mentioning Indian driving to be an indication of some
quick reflexes that we Indians have. ;) On the whole it was an
enlightening, humorous and enjoyable talk.
</p>

<p>
I didn't attend too many of other talks.  Amongst the ones that I
did attend, I particularly liked the one by Asim Mittal on using
the Nintendo Wii with Python.
</p>

<p>
On some thought about my experiences at conferences, I think
conferences shouldn't have any talks at all.  Or atleast, I
shouldn't be attending conferences for talks.  They are an excuse
to catch-up with people.  Conferences should have only lightning
talks of 10 mins and sprints.  Talks, with an extensive
explanation of stuff that can be easily found on the web, are a
waste of time.

talk submissions, quite a few interesting ones, this time's PyCon
should be much better than last year's.  Also, David Goodger of
docutils and ReST fame will be the keynote speaker!

Sage Days is a confluence of present and prospective SAGE Users and
Developers. It is an opportunity to come together to share ideas,
brainstorm and hack on Sage. Sage Days 25 is the 25th version of Sage
Days, and is being organized in Mumbai, India. In order to cater to an
Indian audience and scenario, this version has been tweaked
slightly. Sage Days 25 has beginner level tutorials, in addition to
the usual talks and sprints, to help new users get started with Sage
and help promote the use of Sage in India.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Sage is a free, open-source mathematics software system licensed under
the GPL. It combines the power of numerous existing open-source
packages into a common Python-based interface. It's mission is to
create a "viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple,
Mathematica and Matlab". Sage has tools for a broad range of
mathematical areas like Linear Algebra, Calculus, Symbolic Math,
Plotting, Rings &amp; Groups, Graph Theory, Number Theory and
Cryptography. Essentially, "it can do anything from mapping a
12-dimensional object to calculating rainfall patterns under global
warming" - as Science Daily puts it . Eager to get started? Start
here. Apart from being feature rich, it's usability is one of it's
greatest strengths. Sage Notebook, a web-interface for all the math
you'll ever want to do, is really the killer feature! As the Sage
Marketing page says, "The SAGE GUI surely works on your computer box,
because it just runs in Firefox!". Try it Now!

Sage Days 25 is being attended by the creator and lead developer of
Sage, Prof. William Stein. It will also be attended by other
developers of Sage. This would be a great opportunity to meet and
interact with them! The conference will be attended by a plethora of
enthusiastic people from all over the country who use Sage or are
interested in doing so. The conference will also see the presence of
many mathematicians interested in software. Who knows, you may run
into someone you'd want to collaborate with, for your future work!
This event will be a great learning experience, if you are even
remotely interested in math and software for it!

Shantanu and I conducted a workshop on Scipy at GNUnify '10. It
was intended to be an introduction to Scipy and Numpy through
Image processing. We expected an audience which was python
literate. But GNUnify's schedule wasn't too favorable for us. Ours
was the first talk scheduled and we ended up getting people who
only "heard" of Python, the language.
</p>

<p>
We had planned quite a bit of stuff expecting a python literate
audience. But unfortunately, we had to start almost from scratch
and couldn't do all of what we planned. Still, the workshop wasn't
too bad. Nobody left mid-way during the 2 hour workshop; nobody
was dozing either.  I would have liked my first talk at a FOSS
event to be better, though.

I'm now officially a part of the Arch Linux community! Arch Linux
is a lightweight and flexible Linux® distribution that tries to
Keep It Simple.
</p>

<p>
I have started using arch from less than a week or so. It took me
a while, not too long, to realize the beauty of this distro. I was
trying to tweak the settings of my org-mode's remember (on
Karmic), trying to make it work the way I liked it. After breaking
my head with .emacs and lisp for a while, I realized the version
of my org-mode was way different from the version of the docs, I
was reading. It didn't take long to figure out, which version of
org-mode to get. As a matter of curiosity, I checked AUR for the
version, and true to Arch's reputation it was bleeding edge! I was
still using Karmic, since I hadn't got my Arch installation
working the way I like it, yet. Out of laziness. sudo reboot; to
hell with laziness!
</p>

<p>
I was setting up things I regularly use, tweaking my way
around. After a day or so, I find python-numpy is out of date. And
to top it, an orphaned package! I didn't feel one bit good about
this. After some futile attempts to suppress my discomfort, I sat
down to work.
</p>

<p>
After an afternoon of effort, I created my first PKGBUILD. :) I
now have python-numpy installed using pacman! Pleasure to join the
Arch User Community! Also, thanks to lifeeth and Lynus Vaz, for
the sparks.
</p>

<p>
PS: I'm using Arch with Openbox. It's neat! PPS: org-mode is
really awesome! It's a world in itself. life in plain text,

This post's been inspired by a wonderful book, "A Byte of
Python"<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/a-byte-of-python.html#fn.1">1</a></sup> by Swaroop C H. The book has been revised after a
gap of nearly 4 years and the wait is worth it! I thoroughly loved
the book, and I'm happy to be accompanied by so many<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="/posts/a-byte-of-python.html#fn.2">2</a></sup>
others<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/a-byte-of-python.html#fn.3">3</a></sup>. This book has filled me with a sense of joy and
pride. The pride, of being part of such a wonderful community, a
beautiful crowd. Further, it is a matter of pride, the book's been
authored by an Indian - its quite rare to find such books written
by people in this part of the world.

I have loved python, the moment I started using it. There are
quite a few occasions, where I did something, just because I had
the power of Python with me. Python is undoubtedly amongst the
best, not just as a first programming language, but to give the
user a sense of "do-able-ity" and I am thoroughly enjoying it.

Beautiful is better than ugly.

Simple is better than complex.

Errors should never pass silently.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Well, this isn't an update of how I'm doing on my sabbatical. Its
just been 3 days and I'm doing pretty fine.  I just finished
writing a script to keep my blogs page in sync with my
google-reader (well not exactly). The script parses an xml export
of my google-reader-subscriptions and updates the edits the html
of my unnought-blogs page. period.
</p>

<p>
There are a couple of things I don't like about this script.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, I don't want to keep exporting my
google-reader-subscription each time I make changes. The script
should be able to directly sync with my google-reader without me
having to export the file.  [I have read about the atom
subscriptions feed of Google Reader, but haven't been able to get
it right.] Hopefully, I'll be able to do it in the near future.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, The blog author's name is non-existent. I can't do
anything about this though.
</p>

<p>
Also, In the process, I had the chance to look a geeky ad. I found
it at the weirdest of places!

Other than this, the summer has been relatively uneventful but for
the two FOSS events I attended. Yes, two events, Sat and Sun, both
by Twincling (There are two different Twinclings! Don't ask me
why) Hoping to have some more action this summer!

PS: There's a Big discussion presently on whether lafoobot is a he
or a she. ;) What do you think?

I'll be on board the Amaravathi Express in less than three hours
from now! Bags packed, I'm waiting for the sun to rise, the World

I have set my self an objective of completing 40 problems from
Project Euler. I have done 39. [With exams going on I consider it
good progress] I will be attempting to push off the last one
before leaving. Here I come, Project Euler. Here I come,
Hyderabad!
