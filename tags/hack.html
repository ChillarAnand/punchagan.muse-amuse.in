super fun!

At home, my video would always show a silhouette in G+ and Skype, and
I always thought that this was because the lighting at home was not
sufficient.  At office, the video was decent.  But, moving to sit
right under the light also didn't help much.
</p>

<p>
Struggling with a bunch of tools like <code>v4lctl</code>, <code>guvcview</code> didn't
help. But, during these struggles I noticed that <code>cheese</code> would show
me bright and cheerful, while all the other programs showed my
silhouette.
</p>

<p>
I set out to "fake" the output of <code>cheese</code> as a video device that
skype and other programs could use. But, I didn't have to go all the
way.  I ended up using <a href="https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback/">v4l2loopback</a> to create a loopback video device,
and just using <code>gst-launch</code> to redirect video to that device, did the
trick!  Thanks gstreamer!  Thanks v4l2loopback! :)

        <div class="post"> <p>
I was playing around with a few ideas for creating a timeline for the
mumbai ultimate group, and as a part of playing around with stuff, for
that idea, I ended up wanting to scrape all the emails on our google
group.  After looking around a little bit, I failed to find anything
that claims to be able to do this.
</p>

<p>
So I ended up writing my own <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/7947337">hacky script</a> to download all the emails
sent on the group.  Like I said, this is a hack and can be improved
quite a bit, but I am not inclined to do anything about it, right
now.  Since, everything about google groups is ajaxy, this script uses
selenium and does things on the page, that one would do by hand.  It's
not something that I am proud of, but it does the job!

<a href="http://twitter.com/avudem">Voodoo</a> found a broken link referring to a one of my posts, on Quora.
Given that I have changed my site generator a bunch of times now, it
is quite possible that there are other broken links at various other
places.  So, I implemented a smart <a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/this-is-a-fun-hack">404 page</a> for the site, yesterday.
It is very similar to something I came across on <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/04/07/fun-with-intelligent-404-pages/">brettterpstra</a>'s site.
I just <a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/assets/js/suggestions.js">hooked up</a> <a href="http://kiro.me/projects/fuse.html">fuse.js</a> with Nikola's <a href="http://getnikola.com/handbook.html#local-search">tipue-search plugin</a>'s output
file.  My glue code essentially, just figures out the search term from
the URL, performs a Fuse search on the json data created by Nikola's
search plugin, and returns a list of top 5 results.  It just took me
about an hour to write, but is pretty useful, I think.

Sigh! I made yet another change to the way this blog gets published.
But, I have a feeling this mechanism, is here to stay!
</p>

<p>
We've been using Nikola quite regularly for our <a href="http://ultimatesport.in">Ultimate site</a>, and I
quite like it.  I've also contributed a bunch of features to Nikola to
get it to work the way I would like it to.  This weekend I ported my
blog from <a href="https://github.com/renard/o-blog">o-blog</a> to <a href="http://getnikola.com">Nikola</a>.  The only thing that was stopping me
from doing it, until now is the fact that all my posts are in
org markup and porting them over to one of the formats that Nikola
supports would be a PITA.  So, I wrote a <a href="http://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode">pretty simple plugin</a> to
Nikola to support posting from org files.  And then with a <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/6970578">little
Python</a>, I was able to move everything over to use Nikola.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, I'll keep my blog more updated, from here on!

If you aren't already aware of it, I'm one of those people who
goes around saying, "GitHub is my Facebook".  I spend quite a lot
of time on GitHub, browsing the work of various people, looking at
loads of interesting stuff that people built.  I keep jumping
between people pages and projects using the Watchers/Watching &amp;
Followers/Following pages.  This way, I do come across interesting
people and projects, but the SNR is too low.  I wanted a better
way to be able to see stuff, that I find interesting.  That's how
the idea for this Chromium app – GitHub Cue – was born.
</p>

<p>
@baali and I hacked on this, during the last few days and got it
working.  It works as follows, (from the README) —
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Scrapes all the descriptions of the repositories being watched
by the user.
</li>
<li>Key terms are extracted from this description text using the
Yahoo Term Extractor.
</li>
<li>A list of languages is obtained, based on the languages of the
repositories, the user if watching.
</li>
<li>GitHub searches are performed for a combination of 3 randomly
chosen languages and 5 random key terms.
</li>
<li>10 random repositories out of all these, are shown.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
This is a very simplistic algorithm, but works decently for my
purposes.  Ideally, I would've liked to use a Collaborative
Filtering algorithm, but I found the data to be too sparse, and
the amount of computation to be too much to be done on the fly.  I
wasn't really interested in pre-computing stuff and putting it
onto my server.  I settled down to the next best thing I could
think of.
</p>

<p>
I would appreciate any further ideas and suggestions.  Thanks!

        <div class="post"> <p>
This is some fun I had, trying to replicate what was written in
this post. I had been trying to understand what was happening
here, and found this post on Hacker News very helpful.
</p>

<p>
It is a known fact that our eyes have more cones for green and
red as compared to blue.  The Bayer filter used for digital camera
lenses is based upon this principle.  This post tries to
illustrate that using the following two arguments.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Looking at only the blue channel of an image looks very dark.
</li>
<li>Tripling the pixel size of blue channel doesn't cause much
distortion in the final image.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hence, our eyes suck at blue.
</p>

<p>
Their argument is flawed, but we could try and improve a few
things.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Looking at the blue channel.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This is definitely flawed, since the intensity of blue in the
image they have taken may be less and hence giving us a false
positive.
</p>

<p>
We could instead gray-scale the image and use these pixel values
in the 3 channels and look at the images.
</p>

<p>
This also eliminates the problem of the image being captured
through a Bayer filter.
</p>

<p>
Here's some <code>python</code> code to do the same. (uses <code>matplotlib</code>)

Again, there was this argument of use of Bayer filter affecting
the image and the like.
</p>

<p>
What I did was to swap the channels, and then look at the
images. However I swapped the channels, the image where the
green channel was pixelated always looked the worst.  The
difference between blue and red was less noticeable, I feel.

<p>

I posted a snippet <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/raise-windows-on-current-desktop-xdotool-bash.html#fn.1">1</a></sup> of python code that used xdotool to

enabled raising of windows in the current workspace only.

More importantly, Jordan gave a one-liner <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/raise-windows-on-current-desktop-xdotool-bash.html#fn.3">3</a></sup> in bash,
that could do the same thing as my long and elaborate python
snippet.  I had a feeling that this would be much shorter in bash,
but I don't feel comfortable writing bash scripts. :P

<p>
Below is a bash snippet that tries to incorporates both the
changes. :)

<p>
<b>Note</b>: When you've visual effects enabled (the default option on
Ubuntu), getting the current desktop/workspace doesn't work,
probably because Root Window properties are being messed around by
it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note2</b>: <code>search</code> takes an option <code>--screen</code>. It'd be nice if it
 also had an option <code>--desktop</code>.  This task could then be done in
 a one-liner.

<p>
On April Fools Day of 1998, hackers broke into the MIT web server
and changed the MIT home page to indicate that The Walt Disney
Company had purchased MIT for $6.9 billion.
</p>

<p>
The hacked page contained a link fake to a press release titled
<i>Walt Disney Corporation to Acquire MIT for $6.9 Billion</i>.
</p>

<p>
Later that day the MIT News Office issued a press release titled
<i>MIT says "Disney buys MIT" hack revealed by low price</i>

From: "Harley D. Eades III"

Subject: Tribute to freedom.

Hello,

One late rainy night I had an idea. There is a hill on IL route 29
in Peoria IL, that people climb and write a small message across
this hill for everyone to view from a far. What would be better
than spreading my two most favorite words across this hill. So we
set out with a little over 200 garbage bags and nearly 400
nails. 12:30am and rainy so you can figure that a hill of that
size is going to be slippery (lol) nearly falling down hill with
every step we start building each letter. At around 2:30am we have
finished and now the sun will rise over a hill which spreads the
words Free Software to every person that passes by. This is by far
a vary small non-complex hack but I beleve it is a hack in it
self. This is a tribute to Free Software [and the GNU Project].

Happy Hacking
