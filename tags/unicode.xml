&lt;li&gt;Unicode issues: it turned out that (atleast) one of the files had a character
that wasn't UTF-8 encoded. I got around it by trying 'utf-8', if not falling
back to 'iso-8859-1'.  Now that I think about it, I should fallback to
'utf-8' with replace, if that doesn't work either.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did a little clean up on the way the indexes were stored, to be able to
have a &lt;code&gt;getfile&lt;/code&gt;, to mimic &lt;code&gt;inspect&lt;/code&gt;'s API.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also "improved" the IPython startup script to monkey-patch the source code
formatter/colorizer to not break with C modules.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The one-on-one with Allison was pretty useful, and I feel a little more
relaxed now.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I paired with Kyle to get streaming audio working for his OSX app.  It
doesn't work yet, but we made progress! Hope to get it working today.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent the late evening trying to refactor some of the code and clean it up.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, updating the py-clang code to the latest version fixed the issue of
unknown cursor kinds.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I may present my project in today's presentations!
&lt;/li&gt;
