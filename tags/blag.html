Staying in touch with people is something I'm not very good at.  Since I am not
on popular (among my friends/family) networks – FB and Whatsapp – I don't
even see random updates from people, to get some sense of being in touch.
</p>

<p>
I recently read some old posts by Sacha Chua and was inspired by how much code
she had for <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/geek/emacs/bbdb/">contact management</a> in her old blog posts.  I was inspired by <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2005/05/keeping-in-touch/">this
post</a> in particular to try and be more meticulous about how I stay in touch with
people. Michael Fogleman <a href="https://mwfogleman.github.io/posts/08-01-2015-emacs-can-keep-in-touch.html">blogged</a> about his contact management work-flow using
<code>keepintouch</code>. It seemed to do most of what I wanted, but I wanted this to be
integrated with my <code>org-contacts-db</code> and I felt having native elisp code would
make it easier to hook up email, chat, etc. to this.
</p>

<p>
I ended up writing a small utility called <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/howdy/">howdy</a> to help me keep in touch with
people. It currently has only a couple of features:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<code>M-x howdy</code> lets me update the last contacted timestamp for a contact.
</li>
<li>Shows me contacts that I'm out of touch in the agenda, once I add the
following snippet to an agenda file.
<div class="highlight"><pre>* Howdy
  %%(howdy-howdy)
</pre></div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I also have a few hooks to hook up jabber messages and email to update the
db.  I've added them to <code>howdy-hooks</code> in case anybody else wants to use them.
They can also be used as examples to write other hooks. Feel free to contribute
other hooks or suggest improvements.  The library also ships with a modest test
suite, that will hopefully make it easier for others to contribute.
</p>

<p>
I'm looking forward to experimenting with this over the next few weeks and
improving it. Hopefully, it'll help me keep in touch, better than I do now.

    <div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
To update some data plan changes, I had to restart my router today.  I did so
from the (web) admin interface, from my dad's laptop. Guess what!  The router
goes invisible (to the laptop), after the restart!  Other devices were still
happily connected.
</p>

<p>
There were a few occasions in the past when this laptop had failed to find our
home router.  The solution that worked for my dad before was to restart the
router; once, or may be a couple of times.  But, this time it didn't work.
</p>

<p>
I had a feeling this was something to do with "Channels", but I had no idea
what was going on.
</p>

<p>
I logged onto the router and started looking at the Wireless settings in the
hope of finding some clue, and there it was! <code>Wireless Channel: Auto Scan</code>
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/images/auto-scan.jpg" alt="auto-scan.jpg">
</p>
</div>

<p>
It was anybody's guess that some channels that the router uses weren't
supported by my dad's laptop.  The restarts <b>sometimes</b> helped because the
router would scan for channels that it thinks would work well, and end-up using
something that the laptop's wifi card supported.
</p>

<p>
The router only had options of channels from 1 to 13.  To see what channels a
wifi card supports, you can run the <code>iwlist freq</code> command.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>iwlist freq
</pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre>eth1      26 channels in total; available frequencies :
	  Channel 01 : 2.412 GHz
	  Channel 02 : 2.417 GHz
	  Channel 03 : 2.422 GHz
	  Channel 04 : 2.427 GHz
	  Channel 05 : 2.432 GHz
	  Channel 06 : 2.437 GHz
	  Channel 07 : 2.442 GHz
	  Channel 08 : 2.447 GHz
	  Channel 09 : 2.452 GHz
	  Channel 10 : 2.457 GHz
	  Channel 11 : 2.462 GHz
	  Channel 12 : 2.467 GHz
	  Channel 13 : 2.472 GHz
	  Channel 14 : 2.484 GHz
	  Channel 36 : 5.18 GHz
	  Channel 38 : 5.19 GHz
	  Channel 40 : 5.2 GHz
	  Channel 42 : 5.21 GHz
	  Channel 44 : 5.22 GHz
	  Channel 46 : 5.23 GHz
	  Channel 48 : 5.24 GHz
	  Channel 149 : 5.745 GHz
	  Channel 153 : 5.765 GHz
	  Channel 157 : 5.785 GHz
	  Channel 161 : 5.805 GHz
	  Channel 165 : 5.825 GHz
</pre></div>

<p>
So, the laptop's wifi card support all the channels that the router could use.
<code>iwlist freq</code> also gives the current Channel if the device is already connected
to a router.  I ran this on my laptop and found that the router was using
<code>Channel 13</code>.  Why the hell wouldn't this work?!  I don't know!
</p>

<p>
I decided to set a channel manually, but how do I pick a channel?  The idea of
"Auto Scan" is to find a channel that has relatively low interference.  How do
we do this manually?  <code>sudo iwlist scan</code> scans for all the WiFi access points
nearby and gives detailed information about them, which includes the Channel.
</p>

<p>
It looked like most of the routers nearby used channels 1 and 6, with a few 3s
and 4s.  Assuming, most of the other routers aren't doing this "Auto Scan"
business, I set my router to always use Channel 9, and the laptop seems to be
happily connected, now!

I've started using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/np1/mps-youtube/">mpsyt</a> to play any music from youtube, since
I'm not really interested in the video.  But, since I use emacs for chat/IRC, I
end up getting youtube links into emacs and opening them opens them up in my
browser. I ended up writing some <code>elisp</code> to play the songs from within an
instance of <code>mpsyt</code> running inside an emacs buffer.

<p>
The current version of mpsyt crashes when run from inside emacs due to a bug in
the code to get the terminal size, which should be fixed once this <a href="https://github.com/np1/mps-youtube/pull/247">patch</a> is
merged.
</p>

<p>
I would've expected <code>thing-at-point-url-at-point</code> to be able to find urls even
when they don't have a schema, but it tries to guess the schema from urls and
fails to work when the url starts with <code>youtube.com</code> instead of
<code>www.youtube.com</code>.
</p>

<p>
I started off using the command-line interface of <code>mpsyt</code> by running it using
<code>shell-command</code> or <code>start-process</code>.  But, it seemed useful to have a buffer of
<code>mpsyt</code> to switch to – easier to search for new music, repeating songs, etc.
Not all tasks/actions are achievable through <code>mpsyt</code>'s command line args.
</p>

<p>
I ended up writing more code than I thought I would have to<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/playing-music-using-mpsyt-from-emacs.html#fn.1">1</a></sup>.  But, I'm

    <p>
Those who read the <a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/learning-to-use-org-drill.html">last</a> <a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/learning-about-spaced-repetition-supermemo-org-drill-et-al.html">few</a> <a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/more-input-sources-for-org-drill.html">posts</a> here, would know that I have been
experimenting with <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html">org-drill</a> (a spaced repetition extension to <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>).  I
have been using the system (almost) religiously for the past 2 months, and I do
find that it has helped a great deal! (in some respects).  I have also spent a
considerable amount of time trying to reduce the friction to put new stuff into
the system, and am constantly on the look out for further improvements.
</p>

<p>
Using this system has definitely helped with retention, and I find that I can
recall quite a few things I have read a few weeks ago, that I would normally
have been unable to. Though, I can recall a lot of information, I have been
having a feeling of "fragmentation": the feeling of just retaining individual
bits/fragments of information, while losing out on actually internalizing the
knowledge; not seeing the big picture, etc.
</p>

<p>
Wozniak (the author of super-memo) <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm">warns against</a> learning without
understanding, and memorizing before actually learning stuff.  I haven't
consciously added stuff into the system that I didn't understand (when I added
it), but, later it does feel like I have lost some connections or the
understanding, and am only holding onto the fragments of information.
</p>

<p>
The problems as explained in (read: as interpreted by me from) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013/ref=sr_1_1/188-6768042-2821103?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421439099&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=make+it+stick&amp;pebp=1421439103302&amp;peasin=674729013">Make it Stick</a>
appear to be:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The understanding (if any) at the time of adding stuff into the
spaced-repetition system is untested.  It may just be familiarity
masquerading as understanding.
</li>

<li>The lack of any spaced repetitions for the overall concept/understanding and
actual repetitions only for individual bits doesn't help retention of the
understanding (even if there was any, in the first place).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To work around this, I'm going to try adding questions that test understanding,
to the system.  The Super-memo team strongly recommends keeping the drill items
small and easy to answer.  This may be helpful in keeping each drill session
short, but I would really like to add conceptual questions to the system, and
see how it goes. I hacked <code>org-drill</code> to allow me to type out answers, before
looking at the "correct" ones.  This is an adaptation of a system that a fellow
Hacker Schooler uses, and shared.  Also, hopefully forcing myself to type out
the answer will help me get around the problem of sometimes saying "yeah I know
that", then looking at the answer only to reaffirm the feeling of familiarity,
rather than actually testing myself.  I'm still going to continue adding quick
and short questions that test "bits of information", though. But, hopefully the
additional conceptual questions are going to tie things together and help fill
in the gaps.  Lets see how this goes!
</p>

<p>
For those interested, my hacks to <code>org-drill</code> below.  The code is really a
hack, and welcome any suggestions on cleaning up the code.
