<li>I finished parts of the phonebook task today.  The code looks ugly,
and very un-haskelly.  I asked for feedback on it, but I guess its
just too ugly for anyone to take the time out to comment on it, and
help me improve it.
</li>
<li>I also tried to read up about Monads, and worked through exercises
from a few different places.  I haven't yet finished the exercises
in Chapter 12 of the UPenn course.  I just looked at them today, and
they seem like a complete bouncer at first glance.
</li>
<li>I went on a really long walk with Naren, and food-hopped with him
while he was telling me stories about the various places he worked
at and the kinds of things he has been working on, and things he
liked and disliked about them.  It has been a good weekend to spend
with Naren!
</li>
<li>Also, the long walk and talking to Chaitu cleared my head a bit, and
I decided to pause the Haskell tutorials and learning for the next
couple of weeks.  I don't really have a project that needs me to
learn Haskell, right now.  I should stick to project and need based
learning, which I enjoy the most.
</li>
<li>Right now, I feel like working on an key stroke acoustic emanation
based key-logger.  Just before applying to Hacker School, I came
across the idea of side-channel attacks, and it sounded pretty
exciting.  I don't intend to snoop onto anybody, but the project
seems to be challenging enough, and I will have quite a bit to learn
about. It will involve signal processing, and learning – both areas
that I have seemed interesting to me for long, but I haven't really
done anything in them.  I plan to work on the idea for a couple of
weeks, and review my progress and chart my future course. The
problem appears to have 2 parts to it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Processing audio, and extracting key-strokes from it.
</li>
<li>Identifying the text, based on a sequence of key-strokes. Though,
in reality each press of a key may not sound the same, for a start
assuming we are able to accurately get a sequence of key-strokes,
the problem would reduce to solving a simple substitution cipher.
I plan to start with this, tomorrow.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, I plan to hang out a lot more with Hacker Schoolers, and let
myself be distracted a lot more by random discussions and
activities, than I have allowed myself to be, in the past few weeks.
I should be writing as much code as I can, while I'm here.  But, I
should also be rubbing elbows with the awesome folks, which I will
only be able to virtually, once I'm out of here.
</li>
<li>Thanks to Amber, I also came across this interesting looking book
called <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813">Apprenticeship patterns</a>.  I plan to read it over the next
week or two.
</li>
<li>I haven't been playing almost any Ultimate here. I atleast need to
work out a conditioning and throwing practice schedule and start
working on it, early next week.  Tomorrow won't work since it's 5am
and I'm still awake!
</li>
<li>I also probably need to get enough sleep!
</li>
<li>Looking forward to the next couple of weeks!

<li>Yesterday was a bit more wandering than usual.  I still have to
finish (actually, start) the last chapter in the UPenn course
(Monads).  I hope to finish it during the weekend.
</li>

<li>I started with reading <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia">Typeclassopedia</a>, in the hope of getting
comfortable with Functors and Applicatives and to get introduced to
Monads.  But, I got distracted before I got to the end of the part
on Functors.
</li>

<li>During the check-ins, Laura and Denise mentioned that they are both
facing problems with OAuth, and would like to pair on it.  I decided
to join them, since I've had reasonable luck with OAuth, though I
knew I didn't understand it very well.  While they were working on
getting it to work on OSX, I was trying to write a simple Python
example to do it, and was getting a weird error about the
<code>response_type</code> being not supported.  I was using <a href="https://github.com/litl/rauth">rauth</a> in a way
very similar to what I had done for <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/statiki/blob/master/statiki.py#L49">statiki</a> but the Hacker School
API server wasn't letting me through.  I could debug it only a
little before lunch, and a little bit after lunch.  And realized
that the <code>response_type</code> had to be one of <code>code</code> or <code>token</code> and not
<code>json</code> or <code>empty</code>.  But this is a required parameter, and I expected
<code>rauth</code> to do the right thing!  I got back to it at the end of the
day, and went through the RFC for OAuth2 and wrote up a simple
Python script to implement the whole thing, without using any 3rd
party oauth libraries.  I think I understand the whole thing much
better now, and will soon write up a blog post on it.
</li>

<li>I spent about an hour or so on reviewing Nava's code (along with
Tom, Amber and Patricia), that generated and solved mazes. We tried
to make small incremental changes to her code, and improve it,
hopefully giving her a sense of how to make the code more
intentional.
</li>

<li>Thursday evening presentations! People here have been working on
such cool stuff!  Maze solvers and percolation probability
calculators, phone gap based mobile applications, a cool Midi based
music generator, an <a href="https://github.com/mveytsman/emm-ess-pee">emulator</a> for MSP430 in Clojure, an event logger
in ObjectiveC that can log to a web server and can be used by
multiple clients to debug communication related issues, a HTTP
server written from Scratch, a web server in Swift, a pattern
matching based library in js, a heuristics based puzzle solver, and
a web editor for jekyll!  Holy cow!  These presentations are
extremely inspiring and will probably be the thing I look forward to
the most, for the next 10 weeks.
</li>

<li>I can't believe it's already end of week 2. 10 more to go!

something new and gain a better understanding of the system I am

VM to rule them all</a>.  It talked about Truffle: an API to implement
an AST parser for any language and Graal: a JIT compiler for the
ASTs.  Later in the day, I also went to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/events/178049922/">Papers we love</a> meetup.
The presentation and the talks were quite interesting!

<li>I've been bookmarking the interesting links that people post on
Zulip and have a lot of reading to do.   It would be nice if I had
an easy way to send stuff on to my kindle. (pdfs, html, etc.).
Instapaper works, but doesn't work as well as I would like it to.  I
just want a simple script that takes a list of urls and does the
right thing.  May be I will write something that uses Calibre, or
even better someone already has.

<li>I worked through exercises 08 and 10 of the haskell course,
yesterday.
</li>
<li>Chapter 8 was about how IO works in haskell.  The exercise didn't
involve too much, except I wasted a lot of time on tracking a
stupidity of mine.
</li>
<li>The next part of the course was an introduction to Functors,
Applicative and Alternative.  I'm not sure I totally understand and
am comfortable with them, but I have been able to get through the
exercises.
</li>
<li>I think it's time for me to start working on some Elm tutorials,
along with the Haskell exercises.
</li>
<li>Also, I had questions about when to use <code>type</code>, <code>newtype</code> and <code>data</code>
and incidentally found <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids#the-newtype-keyword">this section</a> that ended with the following
summary: "If you just want your type signatures to look cleaner and
be more descriptive, you probably want <code>type</code> synonyms. If you want
to take an existing type and wrap it in a new type in order to make
it an instance of a type class, chances are you're looking for a
<code>newtype</code>.  And if you want to make something completely new, odds
are good that you're looking for the <code>data</code> keyword."

<li>Denise is already working on a twitter app that sounds similar to
the idea I had.

<li>I accidentally discovered that evince supports vim-like keybindings,
which is cool.

<li>When writing patterns for a function it helps to write the most
general case first, and then write the edge cases.
</li>
<li>I was feeling a little unproductive in the afternoon and I ended up
attending Zach's talk on <a href="https://github.com/hackerschool/community">Community</a>.  I got a brief overview of the
whole architecture, and got to know a little bit about reactjs and
om. I don't think I'll get around to contributing to the project,
since most of the stack is totally new to me, and I'm not
particularly inclined to learn those things now.
</li>
<li>I was working on Monoids for most part of the day and got through
exercise 7.  I started doing the I/O exercise around the end of the
day.
</li>
<li>The day ended with a talk on jobs related stuff by Nick and Sonali.
It seems super unlikely for me to get a job (in the US), from what I
understood from them.  So, I needn't worry too much about that and
focus on getting better at Haskel and as a programmer in general.

I came super early to try and get some work done in the quiet before
the daily checkins time.  Continued with the Haskell tutorial and
reading the Real World Haskell.
</p>

<p>
Finished a couple of exercises from the UPenn course, that were pretty
straight forward.
</p>

<p>
Also, finished a few exercises from chapter 3 of real world haskell,
and partially finished implementing Graham scan for generating a
convex hull for a set of points.
</p>

<p>
The exercises from both the places involved mainly learning about
Algebraic Data Types.
</p>

<p>
Mary pinged me to ask how the first couple of days were, and it was
good to talk to get a ping from her though I never talked to her.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to continue working on the Haskell exercises today.
</p>

<p>
I also got a couple of ideas for small projects:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since, yelp is blocked from here, nobody can use yelp's API and work
on any projects.  It may be helpful to have an API proxy server that
runs on a different server and forwards any requests coming to it.
</li>
<li>A simple script to create a twitter list for each batch of
Hacker School.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Doing them in Python would be pretty straight forward. I will try to
work on these things in Haskell, once I'm reasonably comfortable with
Haskell.

Finally, I'm at Hacker School.  The day began with introductions,
breakfast and welcomes to HackerSchool.
</p>

<p>
The four rules of Hacker School were reiterated to all of us:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No (Feigning) surprise
</li>
<li>No Well-actuallys
</li>
<li>No Backseat driving
</li>
<li>No Subtle-isms
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It was made clear that each of us should watch ourselves not to break
these rules, and being called on breaking these rules is totally cool,
and we should stop about it and think for a moment and move-on.
Breaking the rules doesn't make us bad hacker schoolers.  We are all
here to learn!
</p>

<p>
I liked the idea of all of us being asked to list out the things that
we are nervous about, and excited about.  I was happy to find that a
lot of the people were nervous about the similar kinds of things I was
nervous about.  I'm not alone!
</p>

<p>
After the check-ins, I started off with the Introduction to <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/">Haskell course</a> by
<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/">Brent Yorgey</a>.  What I did was mostly a recap of what I learned from the first
few chapters of <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">Learn you a Haskell</a>.  I learnt about how credit card numbers
are validated, apart from learning a little bit about lazy evaluation and
thunks.

<p>
The day ended with burritos and game night Mafia!
