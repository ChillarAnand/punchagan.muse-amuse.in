&lt;li&gt;During the weekend, I read up a lot about HMMs and related stuff.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the day, I tried to start writing code for different parts of the
pipeline, and ended up reading about Mel frequency cepstrum related stuff,
and wrote a little bit of code.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later, in the afternoon I paired with some of his iOS code, and helped him
clean up some of it.  I'm not sure how useful it was for him to pair with me,
but â€¦
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The day ended with a talk by Jesse at EBay, titled &lt;a href="http://emptysqua.re/blog/write-an-excellent-programming-blog/"&gt;Write an Excellent
Programming Blog&lt;/a&gt;.  I had already read up his blog post, when the talk was
announced, and so, most of the content was known, but the Q&amp;amp;A session had
some interesting suggestions on how to improve your actual writing.
&lt;/li&gt;
