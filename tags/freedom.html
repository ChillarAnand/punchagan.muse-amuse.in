Three Cheers to 'Free Software'!
</p>

<p>
A toast for GNU on its 25th Birthday!<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/software-freedom-day.html#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
If you intend to ask, what I did on this day, I have nothing to show. I haven't done anything that's tangible but yes, I have re-dedicated myself to the idea of Free Software.
This post intends to shed some light on a few things (if not for the benefit of others, just as a reminder for myself)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Free Software is a matter of liberty, not price. I've often been
in a position that required me to correct people. 'Free
Software' is software that's free as in free speech and not free
beer. For the lack of a better word in english, the word 'free'
which also means gratis has been used. Using the term 'Libre'
sometimes helps and if you are in this part of the world, "mukt"
is the best word to use.
</li>
<li>Free Software<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="/posts/software-freedom-day.html#fn.2">2</a></sup> comes along with four fundamental freedoms. To put
it simply, the freedom to use, study, share and modify any
software.
</li>
<li>Free Software may have the advantage of being 'technically
sounder', but the philosophy is what matters the most to me.
</li>
<li>I will do whatever is possible within my capacity to spread the
philosophy and the associated freedom
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Be Free, My Friend!
</p>

<p>
Here is an extract from one of Stallman's <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/software-freedom-day.html#fn.3">3</a></sup> essays:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We must talk about Freedom
</p>

<p>
Estimates today are that there are ten million users of
GNU/Linux systems such as Debian GNU/Linux and Red Hat
Linux. Free software has developed such practical advantages
that users are flocking to it for purely practical reasons.
</p>

<p>
The good consequences of this are evident: more interest in
developing free software, more customers for free software
businesses, and more ability to encourage companies to develop
commercial free software instead of proprietary software
products.
</p>

<p>
But interest in the software is growing faster than awareness
of the philosophy it is based on, and this leads to
trouble. Our ability to meet the challenges and threats
described above depends on the will to stand firm for
freedom. To make sure our community has this will, we need to
spread the idea to the new users as they come into the
community.
</p>

<p>
But we are failing to do so: the efforts to attract new users
into our community are far outstripping the efforts to teach
them the civics of our community. We need to do both, and we
need to keep the two efforts in balance.

Yes, that's what my PS's been like.. It hasn't turned out to be as
great a learning experience as one would imagine it to be..  [or
atleast I hoped, it would be…] On the contrary, its turning out
to be bad…
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Nowadays, there's a certain danger of the same thing
happening, even in the famous field of physics. I was shocked to
hear of an experiment being done at the big accelerator at the
National Accelerator Laboratory, where a person used deuterium. In
order to compare his heavy hydrogen results to what might happen
with light hydrogen, he had to use data from someone else's
experiment on light hydrogen, which was done on a different
apparatus. When asked why, he said it was because he couldn't get
time on the program (because there's so little time and it's such
expensive apparatus) to do the experiment with light hydrogen on
this apparatus because there wouldn't be any new result. And so
the men in charge of programs at NAL are so anxious for new
results, in order to get more money to keep the thing going for
public relations purposes, they are destroying – possibly – the
value of the experiments themselves, which is the whole purpose of
the thing. It is often hard for the experimenters there to
complete their work as their scientific integrity
demands.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When I first read this {from Feynman's Cargo Cult Science [Adapted
from a Caltech commencement address in 1974]}, I couldn't quite
figure out what or how exactly things are happening and what
exactly Feynman meant by "losing the value of experiments". But,
now I know.. thanks to my PS. A lot of stuff that goes on
here..[at least from what I can see..] is quite similar to (in
fact worse than) this. PS's been absolutely disappointing.. I
don't think I've learnt anything here that's worth the effort of
spending my hols (too), away from home…  [except for Awe-TEM] I
don't think I will be taking back anything with me..  other than
may be, a knowledge of stuff that I shouldn't learn, stuff that I
should keep away for the rest of my life…
</p>

<p>
Feynman is saying this to <b>me</b>, Right now!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
… I have just one wish for you – the good luck to be somewhere
where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have
described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain
your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on,
to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.
