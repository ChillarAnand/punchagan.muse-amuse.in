StringIO in the cStringIO module in Python 2.7.2 doesn't handle
unicode strings properly.  This bug has bitten me on a couple of
occasions, in the recent past.
</p>

<p>
Just making a note for myself:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use StringIO if speed doesn't matter so much.
</li>
<li>Whenever possible, just convert the input to StringIO to a
string, if what you are doing doesn't really require unicode
strings.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Or may be it's just time to move up to Python 2.7.3

If you are new to <code>Python</code>, you should probably stop reading here.
But, if you have used <code>Python</code> and <code>numpy</code>, then read on. Before, that
try these bits of code.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">import</span> <span class="n">numpy</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">numpy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="n">j</span>
<span class="n">print</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The "same thing", in a slightly different way.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">import</span> <span class="n">numpy</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">numpy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="n">j</span>
<span class="n">print</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Both the code blocks, look really the same, until you look carefully.
Under normal circumstances <code>a = a + b</code> and <code>a += b</code> behave exactly
similarly, and we really don't need to bother about the differences
between them.
</p>

<p>
But, <code>+=</code>, which is an augmented assignment operator, actually tries
to perform the operation in-place, unlike the other statement where
<code>+</code> actually returns a new object which is again being referenced by
the name <code>a</code>.
</p>

<p>
But, when dealing with <code>numpy</code> arrays, this will lead to trouble.
When assigning to an array, it's <code>dtype</code> is not changed and hence the
trouble.
</p>

<p>
The right way to use the augmented assignment operator, would be:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">import</span> <span class="n">numpy</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">numpy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">dtype</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">complex</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="n">j</span>
<span class="n">print</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The same thing is explained in this thread.  Also, Thanks to
Bhanukiran for asking me this.

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; hi all
</p>

<p>
&lt;BerntH&gt; hi punchagan   [18:36]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; BerntH: ever used/tried blorg or blorgit?  [18:47]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I like the way org-publish works, but blorg exports one org file as a blog. If blorg were to be re-written on top of org-publish, how should it be done? use one file per post or just one file for the whole blog?  [18:52]
</p>

<p>
&lt;bremner&gt; punchagan: another option is to use ikiwiki and use the org-mode plugin to render pages. This is what i do, although only a bit of the site is in org.  [19:44]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; bremner: can I have a look at your site?  [19:45]
</p>

<p>
&lt;bremner&gt; sure, it ain't pretty, but: www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner  [19:46]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; thanks. I'll keep this in mind.   [19:47]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I just loved the way this site looks and behaves – <a href="http://julien.danjou.info/projects.html">http://julien.danjou.info/projects.html</a>
</p>

<p>
&lt;bremner&gt; well, the side bar at least is possible with ikiwiki. Other than that I suppose it is mainly a matter of css  [19:48]
</p>

<p>
&lt;BerntH&gt; punchagan: nope  [19:49]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; ok BerntH  [19:50]
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan ikiwiki does have an org-mode plugin  [19:56]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: yes, bremner told me that and I've seen on Worg too. :)
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan ah, yes, sorry
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: it's alright.   [19:59]
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan another possibility is org2blog, which uses wordpress
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: I'm the author of it. :D
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; lol, ik, <b>that</b> punchagan   [20:17]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; lol
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: were you kidding? or serious?  [20:19]
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan sorry to say i was serious, but it will not happen again :-)
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; i really like org2blog, played with it yesterday
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: no. I was just wondering if you were playing around with me. :P
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I'm happy some one thinks it is useful.
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; lol, no, i just didn't recognized your name, although it is kind of hard to miss  [20:21]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I hope you don't mind, if I make this anecdote public?

Should one take the easy route of asking someone who knows, if she
is sitting right next to you? Or should we try and find out first,
before asking her? Should one value his time more than others' or
others' time more than his own?
</p>

<p>
Would we learn more if we tried to find out ourselves? Does
learning more, make sense? Is it worth spending the extra time?
</p>

<p>
I'm just talking of simple things that you could figure out by
spending a couple of minutes of searching the web or 5 minutes of
thinking or 10 minutes of reading a book.

<code>sort-lines</code> wasn't good enough for me, since it was sorting
alphabetically and it ended up being the sorted order of the urls
and not the names. This function, when used with
<code>org-sort-entries-or-items</code> gave me what I wanted.

<p>
Thanks to benny (on #org-mode), I also learnt the difference
between <code>let</code> and <code>let*</code>.

<p>
I dug up a few links from the web - some that I read, when I

newer links.
</p>

<p>
Just making a note of them here; hoping someone would find it
useful.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How to Become a Hacker - A definitive how-to on becoming a

</li>

<li>Philosophy of the GNU Project - This is the page, where I
started. Thanks to Voodoo for giving me the link to this page. I
distinctly remember that day. :) I'm going to pass on this link
to any newbie who comes my way, no matter how much bashing I get
from other FOSS evangelists.
</li>

<li>6 Easy Ways To Get Started Programming Open Source - A neat list
giving steps to get started with programming for open source. I
like #4. Understanding the social dynamics of the project is an
important thing which is often overlooked by newbies.
</li>

<li>OpenHatch - A community site to help newbies get started with
contributing to FOSS. A cool site. Also, here is a story about
OpenHatch.
</li>

<li>Look at the Numbers! - an interesting paper giving quantitative
data in support of using FOSS.
</li>

<li>Ubuntu - Code of Conduct - A nice description of general conduct
expected in any of the FOSS communities, not just Ubuntu.
</li>

South Central Railways(SCR) has banned photography in stations, as
a measure to prevent Terrorism. Terrorism by definition is "the
act of terrorizing; a mode of government by terror or
intimidation." Doesn't this decision by SCR define a victory for
the people they are trying to stop?
</p>

<p>
Anyway, if you are carrying a camera and are tempted to shoot in
the railway station, go get a permission letter from the Chief
PRO. :-/

It's just a co-incidence that this post is coming on
Independence day.
</p>

<p>
Last night I was in an auto with a couple of friends, and the
auto couldn't get up a slope and stopped near the edge of the
slope which was leading onto a main road. We had to get down
from the auto, and after a lot of fight, the auto got on top.
As the driver was trying hard to get the auto moving, a guy
comes over and starts talking to him in Marathi. I'm not sure
if he was a traffic police. He was dressed in white, but
didn't really look like one.
</p>

<p>
After asking a few questions, but not getting any replies, the
guy asks him in Hindi, if he understands Marathi, and on
getting a negative reply, starts shouting on him!
</p>

<p>
The guy harasses the driver, asking him to handover his
license and threatens him of horrible consequences, if he
doesn't do so. We tried to intervene saying, we want to leave
early and stuff, but the auto refused to start. The driver
asked us to leave and said he'll take care of the matter.
</p>

<p>
And then, today I hear people talking of national integration
and stuff. I hear stuff about changing the country, getting
rid of corrupt politicians and all the high ideals crap. I
keep hearing all sorts of patriotic songs that I hear only
twice a year. Not once more than that.
</p>

<p>
Why is it that we talk of all this only on these two days of
National importance? Why are these songs played only twice a
year? Don't we get that feeling of patriotism on other days?
Isn't patriotism a "true" feeling?
</p>

<p>
I think, India will only take a leap in it's progress, when
that happens.

I like the idea of pair blogging. Cate and Sacha, seem to be doing
it (intentionally or not). One person blogs on a topic he/she's
presently thinking about and the other person posts his/her views
on the same issue.  Well, comments are meant for that, but a blog
post seems to give you greater freedom.

PS: I called it pair-blogging. I don't know if it already has a

Drafting behind trucks (when cycling) could be a great energy
saver.  I came across this idea when reading up a blog post by a
cyclist.
</p>

<p>
The idea is similar to birds flying in a V-shape to get a greater
lift.  While drafting, the goal is to reduce the drag force.
</p>

<p>
Pacelines in cycling races are formed precisely for this reason.
This page has a short summary of what drafting is all about.

Should be trying this out, the next time around.

        </h1>
        <div class="post"> <p>
Below is a mail sent by Eric Schulte to the org-mode mailing list
answering a query on how to write elisp for org-mode. I am
reproducing it here, since it is useful advice for me. The actual
thread is here.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
The way that I learned how to program in emacs lisp was mainly
using two commands `elisp-index-search' bound to `C-h e' on my
system, and most importantly `describe-function' bound to `C-h f'.
With `describe-function' you can look at the source code of
functions whose behavior you are familiar with, you can then copy
portions of the code to your <b>scratch</b> buffer where they can be
edited and evaluated with `eval-defun' bound to `C-M-x'.  Now with
Babel, instead of doing this in the scratch buffer you could do
this in emacs-lisp code blocks in an org file, enabling notes and
hierarchical organization – it can be nice to have your noodling
all collected in one file for later reference.
</p>

<p>
If you are going to do any serious work with lisp, I would
emphatically recommend using paredit-mode, and becoming friends
with the Sexp movement functions
</p>

<p>
C-M-f        runs the command paredit-forward
C-M-b        runs the command paredit-backward
C-M-u        runs the command backward-up-list
C-M-k        runs the command kill-sexp
C-y        runs the command yank
</p>

<p>
They allow you to manipulate lisp code on the level of logical
expressions, the utility of which can not be over stated.
</p>

<p>
As for working with Org-mode in particular, I'd recommend looking
at the documentation and source-code of Org-mode functions with
`describe-function', and then looking for how these functions are
actually used in the Org-mode code base with `rgrep'.
</p>

<p>
For a more structured learning experience, I've heard very good
things about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/</a>,
although I haven't used it myself.
</p>

<p>
Hope this helps.  Happy Hacking – Eric

First re-post using no content and give the post some time for it

Heavy down-pour and landslides caused our train to be delayed by
over 12 hours. But the journey was on the whole enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
The novelty of the journey was that we had a bus ride from Adavali
to Ratnagiri, arranged by the Indian Railways, owing to bad tracks
near Ratnagiri.  It was very well planned and neatly executed.
Kudos Indian Railways!  The Konkan Rail route was at it's usual
best.

I just wanted to thank Sacha Chua for bearing with my newbie elisp
code and trying out org2blog.
</p>

<p>
Also, thanks for the two patches she sent.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Feature addition - Posting sub-trees instead of whole buffers.
I had this feature in mind, and had started working on it after
her request, but she was too quick for me! ;)
</li>
<li>Cleaning up of the code that uploads images.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I'm loving it!

No.  Not the Obama change.  I'm talking of change as in small
denominations of cash.  Everybody is reluctant to part with
it.  There's always a problem with getting it.  I'm often worried
before getting into a bus or an auto, or going to a shop whether
or not the guy would give me change for a 50, 100 or a 500.
People so reluctant to "part" with it. What are they saving it
for?
</p>

<p>
I think the situation would be much better if people readily gave
it, when required.  There would be a free flow and if not anything
more, I wouldn't have to worry about it when going somewhere.
But, I "feel" this would actually reduce the instances when both
the parties don't have enough change with them. What do you think?

I've often got bad service from "service providers" - hotels,
restaurants, phone services, Internet services etc. I guess that's
due to the population in India. If one customer goes back unhappy
that doesn't really make a difference, because there would be
hundred others already waiting in the queue.
</p>

<p>
You, as a, service provider would get your share of customers and
profits, no matter how bad you are. Thanks to the population.
</p>

<p>
One solution could be, to write about the bad service you got from
a provider and make people aware of it, but often there aren't
enough options, for others to choose from. Inevitably, the bad
service provider is going to get some customers. What's the way
out?

After a trek, I had an interesting conversation with Ritesh, about
taking pictures during a trip. He said, he started to realize that
when he's lost in the cycle of click, see, analyze, click,
… when he's got a cam in his hand. He didn't have a cam on this
trek and thoroughly enjoyed it!
</p>

<p>
I connect to this phenomenon, as well. I think, like Ritesh says,
having separate trips for Photography makes sense. On other trips,
we could be clicking, but just for the sake of memory. Trying to
get amazing photographs shouldn't be a goal.
I should refrain from -
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>looking at the output and adjusting repeatedly until it's
perfect.
</li>
<li>clicking too many pictures in a given length of time.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For both of this, a film camera seems to be the solution!
</p>

<p>
What say, Ritesh?
