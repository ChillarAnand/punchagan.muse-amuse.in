how do you determine a need that isn't being fulfilled and might be
the basis for a project/business? Two ways. You could ask people
what problems they have that you might be able to help solve, or
(for introverts like me) examine what processes or services feel
needlessly difficult in your own life.

Dewey-Hagborg’s work is super interesting, not to mention searingly
contemporary. “It’s a very accessible way for the public to engage
with this new technology. It really brings to light how powerful it
is, the idea that a hair from your head can fall on your street and
a perfect stranger can pick it up and know something about it,” she
says, adding: “With DNA sequencing becoming faster and cheaper, this
is the world we’re all going to be living in.”

<p>
So many books, so little time. With this in mind, the Amazon Books
editors set out to compile a list of 100 Books to Read in a
Lifetime. We had a few goals when we started out: We wanted the list
to cover all stages of a life (which is why you'll find children's
books in here), and we didn't want the list to feel like
homework. Of course, no such list can be comprehensive – our lives,
we hope, are long and varied – but we talked and argued and sifted
and argued some more and came up with a list, our list, of
favorites.

<p>
Any software project is a collaborative project. It has at least two
developers, the original developer and the original developer a few
weeks or months later when the train of thought has long left the
station. This later self needs to reestablish the context of a
particular piece of code each time a new bug occurs or a new feature
needs to be implemented.
</p>

<p>
Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can't
avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it to as
small as possible. Commit messages can do exactly that and as a
result, a commit message shows whether a developer is a good
collaborator.

<p>
The best approach is more indirect: if you have the right sort of
background, good startup ideas will seem obvious to you. But even
then, not immediately. It takes time to come across situations where
you notice something missing. And often these gaps won't seem to be
ideas for companies, just things that would be interesting to
build. Which is why it's good to have the time and the inclination
to build things just because they're interesting.
</p>

<p>
Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it
sounds, that's the real recipe.

Machine Learning (or ML) offers the promise of having a computer
pour through your data and automatically extract or create the
information that you’re interested in. At least in theory. On closer
inspection machine learning is a loosely defined collection of
poorly explained statistical and algorithmic tricks that are magical
when they work and fail fantastically when they don’t. Acquiring the
needed skills for working with data safely is not easy. So we’ve
assembled a solid set of suggestions and resources on getting
started.

<p>
Between The Great Backlash Against Waterfall Design and The Supreme
Acceptance of Agile Development, something was lost. Don't get me
wrong, waterfall design takes things way too far. Huge systems
specified in minute detail end up being the WRONG systems specified
in minute detail. We were right to strike it down. But what took its
place is too far in the other direction. Now we have projects with
short, badly written, or entirely missing documentation. Some
projects don't even have a Readme!
</p>

<p>
This is not acceptable. There must be some middle ground between
reams of technical specifications and no specifications at all. And
in fact there is. That middle ground is the humble Readme.

the things you need to be doing right - stance, breathing, form,
recovery, chalking up, everything - and do them right. Quit faffing
around!

A training session is about an hour long, of mostly lifting stuff
and time between lifting stuff, where you recover. If this isn't
what you do, sleeping in is a better option.

The map, at that point, will just be data: a way for our phones,
cars and who knows what else to navigate in the real world. Whose
data will that be: Google’s? Ours? Our car company’s? It’s too soon
to tell. But one thing seems certain, O’Reilly says. In the end,
“the guy who has the most data, wins.”

The next time you see an application you like, think very long and
hard about all the user-oriented details that went into making it a
pleasure to use, before decrying how you could trivially reimplement
the entire damn thing in a weekend. Nine times out of ten, when you
think an application was ridiculously easy to implement, you’re
completely missing the user side of the story.

<a href="http://housesofgoa.com/about.html">Houses of Goa - About the Project</a>

<p>
The history of Goa is intrinsically linked to the many centuries of
Portuguese presence and rule. Before the arrival of the Portuguese,
most Goan houses were mostly made of mud and had a thatched
roof. They faced inwards towards a central courtyard and had small
windows, mostly devoid of ornaments.
</p>

<p>
The Portuguese arrived in Goa in 1510 and brought with them a host
of cultural and aesthetic influences from Europe and other
places. Goans who travelled abroad also returned with ideas and
influences from other countries that they incorporated into their
houses.

“If you want to describe a specific person in detail, I cannot do it
in a general scheme. There is a general scheme, but there are plenty
of specific ramifications that drive you to be the person that you
are. For a planetary system it is the same thing. That’s chaos:
extreme sensitivity to tiny changes.”

cardinal, fundamental law of programming:

It’s harder to read code than to write it.

The idea that new code is better than old is patently absurd

<p>
Born of human error, continually generating copious heat, the
Elephant’s Foot is still melting into the base of the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant. If it hits ground water, it could trigger
another catastrophic explosion or leech radioactive material into
the water nearby residents drink. Long after bleeding from the core,
this unique piece of waste continues to be a testament to the
potential dangers of nuclear power. The Elephant’s Foot will be
there for centuries, sitting in the dark basement of a concrete and
steel sarcophagus, a symbol of one of humankind’s most powerful
tools gone awry.

I told you before that the purpose of mathematics is insight, but I
think I lied. Even more than that, the reason I do math is the
excitement and uncertainty of the chase. There is no joy in applying
a computer algorithm, but there is joy in unlocking the delicate
clockwork mechanism that makes a good math problem tick. And, in the
end, you just might learn something that nobody else in the world
knows!
</p>

<p>
… Oh, and by the way, I really don’t believe that honesty is merely
a wasted opportunity to cheat. I said that just for effect. Honest.
