I've been trying to use &lt;code&gt;org-drill&lt;/code&gt; regularly for the last few weeks.  I don't
know how well it's been going but I have been sticking to the routine
religiously.  I haven't yet really tried out incremental reading, but in an
attempt to make it as easy as possible, I wanted to have a pdf-reader
integration, and some kind of integration with Kindle highlights.  Browser
integration is pretty straight-forward, thanks to some &lt;a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#sec-6"&gt;simple java-script&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I looked for a pdf-reader with some sort of plugin support, but I found nothing
in Evince or Okular.  I thought about &lt;code&gt;pdfjs&lt;/code&gt; but it seemed slightly clunky to
open pdfs in a browser, though I might shift to this if I don't like what I
finally ended up with.  Good old &lt;code&gt;xpdf&lt;/code&gt; seemed to be the only pdf reader that
had some support for custom keybindings that allowed users to run external
commands.  With a &lt;a href="https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/xpdf-capture"&gt;little Python&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to setup a work-flow to capture
snippets from &lt;code&gt;xpdf&lt;/code&gt;, to add to org-drill. Custom key-bindings somehow don't
seem to work on &lt;code&gt;xpdf&lt;/code&gt; bundled on Ubuntu. So, I ended up downloading and using
the binary available on the xpdf site.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For Kindle highlights support, with minor updates to Thamer Mahmoud's &lt;a href="https://github.com/punchagan/clip2org"&gt;clip2org&lt;/a&gt;,
I have a simple way of getting all the "new" clippings/highlights as org-drill
headlines.  I haven't really started using this, and once I do, I may end-up
automating even the merging of these items into the org-drill notes file.  I'm
looking forward to making better use of my Kindle, with this feature!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't know if it would be useful to have more context information like
section titles/chapter titles when capturing from html/pdf, but it seems like
an interesting problem to try to solve.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also, it might be easier(?) if I probably tried to have a DE level keybinding, and
some code to get selection and file name of the currently active
window/application.

I have been reading a bunch of articles on the SuperMemo site (including the
&lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol.htm"&gt;original thesis&lt;/a&gt; of P. A. Wozniack, the creator of SuperMemo).  I initially
started off trying to understand the algorithms SM2,5 and 8 which org-drill
implements, but reading the articles has given me a lot of general background
and theory on how memory works, and why SuperMemo is as effective as it is (for
those who stick with it).  This blog post is an attempt to summarize and
capture what I have read in all those &lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/contents.htm"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt;, and not get lost in them.  I
would recommend reading the thesis and the suggested reading there, yourself,
but if you really don't want to – this blog post + the summary in &lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm#Prioritize"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/decalog.htm#decalog"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; would be a good alternative.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory works by repetition.  Each time you recall a fact, the time it takes
for the memory to fade increases.  Spaced repetition is the idea of repeating
items, just when you are about to forget them – trying to optimize the time
spent on learning, as well as the retention of learned material.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Prioritization of the items we need to learn is key to being able to stick to
Spaced repetition.  Beginners tend to be over-enthusiastic about the
technique and fill up their system with stuff that they don't really care
about.  Applicability of the knowledge you are trying to gain, is a good test
for whether or not it goes into your system.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Each version of SuperMemo comes with a slightly modified (on most occassions,
improved!) algorithm.  SM2, SM5, … refer to these algorithms. Org-drill
currently supports only sm2,5 and 8.  It may be worth looking at sm15/16 and
seeing if it can be implemented and is worth doing.  In any case, using any
of these is &lt;b&gt;way&lt;/b&gt; better than not using Spaced repetition at all.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Understanding what we are trying to learn goes a long way in helping
memory. It is, therefore, good to start with basic material. People have been
surprised by how easily the advanced stuff fell into place, once they had the
basics covered.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Keep items in the system simple.  Stick to the minimum information
principle.  Keeping it simple, doesn't mean you leave out on learning the
complex stuff; instead break it into simpler components.  Simpler items has
the following advantages:

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple is easier to remember.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simpler items are easier to schedule.  You get more resolution to figure
out what the problem areas are.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple makes brings in redundancy automatically.  And &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redundancy_is_good"&gt;redundancy is good&lt;/a&gt;
for memory, just like it is for managing hardware failure.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Keep learning fun!  Don't make review sessions a chore.  Think about the
material you are reviewing. Edit/delete/improve items based on your reviews,
then and there. Stay active.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It is useful to add a link to the source of the items added to your system,
considering that you wish to use the system over a long period of time
(ideally, the rest of your life!)
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Prioritize, add examples, appeal to your emotional state, link to existing
knowledge, use images. Anything else that works for you!  Use all of these
techniques, that work well and you probably already use in everyday life, in
the items you add to your system, to make them easier to recall.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Being physically fit and healthy is important for being so
mentally. Exercise, sleep, eat well, avoid caffeine.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Try &lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm"&gt;incremental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/devour.htm"&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt;, as an input source of items into your memory system.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><category>learning</category><category>life</category><category>memory</category><category>software</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/learning-about-spaced-repetition-supermemo-org-drill-et-al.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2014 13:37:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Learning to use Org-drill</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/learning-to-use-org-drill.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
Org-drill is an Org-mode extension that provides spaced-repetition and
flash-card functionality.  It has a &lt;a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html"&gt;wonderful documentation on Worg&lt;/a&gt;, but
somehow I couldn't get myself to read the whole document, and setup org-drill,
until now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The setup is quite straight forward, once you have org-mode along with the
&lt;code&gt;contrib&lt;/code&gt; packages.  Just &lt;code&gt;(require 'org-drill)&lt;/code&gt;, and you are all set!  To add
a new card, all you need to do is add a &lt;code&gt;:drill:&lt;/code&gt; tag to the items you wish to
"Org-drill".  You can start a review session with simply &lt;code&gt;M-x org-drill&lt;/code&gt;.  You
will be shown flash cards, and you can rate how correct and comfortable you
were, in answering the questions.  Based on your responses, the cards are
scheduled for review.  Start another review session, whenever you need one!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What I could only understand once I got myself to read the whole document was
that:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The default scope of a drill session is the current file.  But, you can start
sessions with scopes like current tree, current directory, or a specified
list of files. This is super-useful!
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The review sessions are not automatically scheduled, based on when you
schedule failed flash-cards.  Scheduling the review for a card only sets a
due-date for them, and effects, what you are asked in your next session.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Cram mode and incremental reading are also things I want to try, as I go along.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Happy Learning!
