&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;Mel's talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mel's talk in the morning was brilliant!  I wonder why it's not a part of
recommended reading for Hacker Schoolers, or referred to, in the manual.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logically, it makes sense that Mel came now, so that she didn't have to come
twice to talk to the firsts and seconds, but it would have been great to have
had this talk in the first week of Hacker School!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mel gave us a lot of new information and insights into education and learning
styles. I also like the fact that she gave us all a good vocabulary to think
about and discuss stuff related to learning. I will try to think, and apply
as much of this as I can, for the rest of my time here.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She talked about &lt;a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2014/02/10/test-driven-learning-setting-learning-goals-for-yourself-software-engineering-edition/"&gt;test driven learning&lt;/a&gt; which seemed very interesting. Instead
of just saying, "wow that would be an interesting thing to do", stop for a
moment, think about what you are trying to learn, and how you will assess if
you have learnt what you wanted to, and then dive into the project.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html"&gt;learning styles&lt;/a&gt; workshop was pretty good too, though I feel like I don't
know myself well enough, and I unable to properly "bucket" myself.  Later, I
took a &lt;a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html"&gt;quiz&lt;/a&gt;, and ended up fairly close to the middle, in all the dimensions.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mel introduced us to the idea of &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/201816780/A-Cognitive-Apprenticeship-Primer"&gt;cognitive apprenticeship&lt;/a&gt;, and encouraged us
to try out the different modes when pairing. I really liked the idea of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development"&gt;Zone
of proximal development&lt;/a&gt; and I will try to take the advice of spending most of
the rest of my time here in this zone.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I (really) care?  Motivation and mindset, …
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be courageous!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;Airplay and Raspberry Pi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was trying to wrap libshairport and use it on the RPi to be able to listen
to songs being streamed on Airplay, and use that data to drive the LEDs.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shairport, a tool written in C seemed to work.  My attempts to wrap
&lt;code&gt;libshairport&lt;/code&gt;, which is a fork of &lt;code&gt;shairport&lt;/code&gt; converting it into a library,
failed miserably.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trouble was essentially getting Airplay to discover my service.  I tried
a bunch of things with &lt;code&gt;pybonjour&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;avahi&lt;/code&gt;, but wasn't able to get it
right.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I tried just announcing the service with &lt;code&gt;shairport&lt;/code&gt;, and actually
running a python script that wraps &lt;code&gt;libshairport&lt;/code&gt; to listen to the data.
But, this didn't work and iTunes complained that this Airplay device is not
compatible. Before going much further with this, I found &lt;code&gt;shairplay&lt;/code&gt; which is
a tool similar to &lt;code&gt;shairport&lt;/code&gt;, but came with a library, and also Python
bindings!  I happily used this to get stuff working!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm interested to see today, what exactly I was missing yesterday!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;Emacs club&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I demoed org-mode to a bunch of people for about half an hour, and it was
good to see people being blown away by what it can do, exactly the way I
was, when I first came across it.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-4"&gt;Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on RPi to clean up a few things for the party.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare &lt;code&gt;libshairplay&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;libshairport&lt;/code&gt; to see what I was doing wrong,
yesterday.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May be write up the whole thing, and make the code available.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn a little bit about Parsers from rntz.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Here's an interesting article by Peter Norvig, Director of
Research Google I have just copied the whole essay here… also
here's a link to the Original one…
