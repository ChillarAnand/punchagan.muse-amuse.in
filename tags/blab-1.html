I am unread.  Unlike you, who classify yourselves as well-read or
not, I am classified as unread or not.  Well, you could call me
not well-read too, I guess.  I was looked at once, my innards
glanced through, and was hurriedly marked as unread, starred and
tagged.  Given my length, the care with which I was composed, and
the flurry with which I was stowed away, I probably contain
something important, to be read at the opportune moment, something
to be cherished and to be replied to with diligence and care.  I
felt a sense of pride.
</p>

<p>
I got composed and sent weeks ago, and have been lying here
untouched, since.  I get buried deeper and deeper every day, with
a daily flood of newer stuff piling up onto me.  While my
composer, eagerly awaits a reply, (less and less eagerly each day,
though) I have lost all hope of being read and replied to.  I
curse myself for carrying something so important.  A thousand
other replies have been sent, and a few thousand others composed
here, but my turn hasn't come, yet.
</p>

<p>
How I wish, it'd be my turn today.  How I wish, I could push my
way up through to the top of the stack.  How I wish, I could see
the eager wait come to an end!  How I wish, I'm given the
attention I deserved, today!  Reply, ASAP!
</p>

<p>
PS: Apologies for all those emails that are still starred and
unread, in my Inbox…

I now have a GNU! I bought it (a GNU soft toy) in memory of my friend
swathanthran from #emacs-in.  RIP swathanthran

As a bonus, I got the chance to have a photograph with just RMS and
me. Also, hoping the monetary contribution will be of some use to
FSF-India.

The thrill of getting the GNU (and the GNU itself) and shaking hands,
getting photographed with RMS is dedicated to all the lafoots and
specially to Voodoo, who taught me the meaning of the word "hacker".

Happy Hacking!

<del>I'd</del> We had been on a 60 km long trip today. My second one, and
Ritesh's first. The map of our route is here. On the whole the ride
was wonderful! A thoroughly enjoyable one. It was near perfect, with
it raining only as much as we enjoyed an not anymore. :)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The ride on Godbander Road was the most enjoyable part of the
ride. Simple Wonderful! That's what made the trip worth it!
</li>

<li>It was more relaxed than my previous ride and it took us about 5
hours on the whole. We must've been pedalling for about 4 hours. I
don't have the "actual" figures.
</li>

<li>Except for the stretch of Western express highway (service road)
from Jogeshwari to a little after the Sanjay Gandhi National park's
entrance, the road was decent. The Eastern Express highway service
road was awesome!
</li>

<li>Cycling alone is totally different from cycling with someone
else. We didn't really go together, but we were meeting up once in a
while. The loneliness, of rides on which you are alone, is
absent. But waiting for, or catching up with the other guy is a bit
tricky. I wonder how it would be with a bigger group.
</li>

<li>I tried to keep going at about 60% effort and I still had quite a
bit of juice left in me, at the end of the ride.
</li>

<li>My cycle is definitely good! I really only understood this after
exchanging my cycle.
</li>

<li>Exchanging cycles felt nice. A slightly different set of muscles
were in action. The newness kinda helped.
</li>

<li>I should probably get myself a bigger round frame spectacles. Or I'm
craning my neck a bit too much, to keep looking ahead, while
pedaling. How about contacts?
</li>

<li>The problem with riding on the left of Highways is that you
"compete" with heavy vehicles. It sometimes gets a bit scary.
</li>

<li>I should get a helmet soon.
</li>

<li>I should get in touch with local cycling groups and tag along with
them on a couple of rides. I'll get to learn a lot of things.
</li>

<li>Ritesh took a few pics with his phone. <del>Photos in some later post or
with an update</del>.
</li>

<li>Where to next? A ride inside the National park, probably or the
wonderful roads of Navi Mumbai.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Kudos Ritesh!
</p>

<p>
<b>UPDATE:</b> A few pictures, that Ritesh clicked on his phone. All the
photos were on the Godbander Road.

After a short break, I'm back to blogging!
A few things have changed meanwhile. A lot haven't.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Noetic Nought shall now be called Rustic Reverie.
</li>

<li>The Blogs I read page is now manually populated. More pages might be
coming soon.
</li>

<li>My web presence has almost been reduced to just this blog. I hope to
be blogging more often this time around. I guess I'll have shorter
and more frequent posts. "Release early, Release often."
</li>

<li>I've been inspired by Sacha Chua and her wonderful blog. She puts up
anything that -
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>she may look up in future.
</li>
<li>could be remotely useful to anybody on this planet.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I like her idea of "thinking of writing as sketching". "Keep
repeating yourself, until the core message floats to the top". It
feels similar to the idea - "Release early, Release often."
</p>
</li>

<li>Also, Thanks to Madhu and Vattam who set an impossibly high standard
by having their resumes and letters of recommendations and other
"personal" stuff on version control on public repositories.
</li>

<li>All my posts will be made from org2blog - a little org-mode based
client that I hacked up. Emacs and Org-mode all the way! This is the
first post by me (and probably anybody) from org2blog!

I want to be a part of the "reader-space" of blogs or web-sites
rather than a part of the Google-reader ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
As most of my readers know, I'm big on Google Reader (and I have a
reputation for that!). I'm a part of a wonderful ecosystem and get
to look-at or read a lot of interesting stuff. I get a lot of
variety, stuff that I wouldn't normally have come across. It keeps
me from staying in a tiny well, reading the same kind of stuff,
over and over again. I also like the fact that it acts as an
archival system for me. I can go back and read posts, which don't
exist on the web, anymore.
</p>

<p>
But, I have a problem with this ecosystem. It's killing the the
communities around the blogs or sites, themselves. The reader
count may have gone up, but the discussion and activity of the
community on the blogs is going down; at least on the blogs I look
at. Blogs are rather dead, these days. But, when one's following
over 200 blogs, you can't expect much better. It is difficult to
keep up with all of them; even the ones that one kept up well
with, before. People stop going back to the comments; stop
participating in the discussion.
</p>

<p>
Do you agree? Do you think it'll help it feed readers keep track
of the comments and updates? Or is the only way to cut down on
feed-reading and getting back to the old exciting way of checking
out blogs? I recall an old quote I read - If it's not worth
remembering, it's not worth reading.
</p>

<p>
<b>UPDATE:</b> I wasn't talking of my blog or comments here, in
 particular (if that's not already clear). I was talking of blogs,
 that I read regularly, blogs of people I know well (including
 mine). But then, there are blogs, that have over 1000 comments on
 a single post, too. Should the above quote could be changed to
 read - "If it's not worth reading, it's not worth remembering." ?

My first Cricket match in a stadium. I regret that it was a
T-20. I'm happy, though, to have got the darshan of bhaiyya a.k.a
Sachin. Also, I did enjoy the energy of being in a stadium.
</p>

<p>
I was actually intent on watching MI vs. RR, but, junta voted in
favor of the Opening Ceremony. It was a grandiloquent let-down,
but for the fireworks. There was nothing really spectacular about
the ceremony. A mediocre performance… With the kind of money
they have at hand, and have spent, I really would've liked
something better.
</p>

<p>
The match. DC vs. KKR. DC lost a game that it could've comfortably
won. It would've been a decent match to watch, if not for the
stupid DJ-ing. The game looked so different from what I'm used to
seeing on the TV. [The only thing that was exactly as I saw in TV
was, the crowd drooling at the cheer girls.]
</p>

<p>
I was shocked by the amount of disturbance a player has to
overcome, while playing. Has the "gentle-man's" game turned into a
"super-man's" game? Between each and every ball, the DJ is either
shouting some incomprehensible inanities or playing some crazy
"number" at the highest volume. The batsmen almost had to wait for
him to shut up, before each ball. Can someone tell me if these are
perks that the third version brings with it, or if I was happily
ignorant, thanks to the TV watching? The heart-beat sound in the
final overs was ridiculously annoying. I was looking forward to
one of the batsmen throwing his bat at the DJ.
</p>

<p>
Also, it's a big joke to call this ground a "home" for DC. It was
nothing close to a home ground, in terms of the crowd. I don't see
Cuttack being any more homely, especially with the Kalinga Sena
already passing crazy orders to the cricketers. DC will have to
play exceedingly well to end-up anywhere near the top.  But,
amidst all this, I'm happy for the people of AP. With a huge
electric-power crisis looming ahead, they have already saved (or
produced) power worth 7 IPL matches!
</p>

<p>
Also, this is the end of IPL v3 for me. I'm done with cricket for
this season.
