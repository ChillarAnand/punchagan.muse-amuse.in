    <p>
I stumbled on a <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/178-rr-book-club-refactoring-ruby-with-martin-fowler/">Ruby Rogues podcast</a> yesterday, which had <a href="http://martinfowlwer.com">Martin Fowler</a> as the
guest.  I really enjoyed the discussion on Refactoring (the noun, the verb and
the book!)
</p>

<p>
Martin clarified in the podcast that refactoring (the verb/process) is a
sequence of very small refactorings, while you keep making sure that you can
run the test suite always.  A refactoring (noun) is a change where you change
the structure of the code without any externally observable changes, with the
intent of making it easier to understand and cheaper to change in future.
</p>

<p>
I also really liked the metaphor of a 'healthy code base'.  Refactoring is,
then, the process of keeping healthy – exercise, speaking metaphorically.  You
can stack up all the exercise you need to do, until you get really unfit.
Refactoring, similarly, needs to be done regularly, to keep the code base
healthy.  This lets you go faster, in the future.
</p>

<p>
I also really liked the advise about trying to push back the mental contexts
you build, while trying to debug/understand some code that is not very clear,
by refactoring the code to make it clearer.  Code needn't be one big chunk of
cryptographic text.  Code is writing.  It should be clear and understandable.
Or, at least we should strive to make it so!
</p>

<p>
The discussion, as always on this podcast, was very lively, pleasant and
enjoyable! Enjoy!

<li>As preparation for a one-on-one this week with one of the facilitators, I was
wondering if I was really getting better as a programmer, by doing what I am
doing.
</li>
<li>I have heard at numerous places that reading and reflection are keys to
getting better. I feel like I haven't been giving these things much attention
in the past couple of weeks. I don't catch up on reading all the awesome
reading material shared on Zulip and I switched from writing this blog post
first thing in the morning, to any-time-after-lunch. I don't think this
worked out very well. Writing the post worked as a way to reflect on what I
had done yesterday, and what I should be doing today. So, I am back to
writing the blog post, first thing in the morning!
</li>
<li>Yesterday, I worked on indexing the Python sources in a way that the
inspection code can look up, later.  During this process, I found that my
code to use libclang's AST wasn't generic enough, and I had to clean it up to
be able to extract useful information from any file in the <code>cpython</code> sources.
</li>
<li>We also got to attend a super-awesome talk by <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Labnik</a>! He talked about
his progression from being an application developer, to writing libraries, to
working on languages (as a professional developer). He made a lot of
interesting and inspiring points during his talk.  Some of those that stuck
with me are:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>None of these is particularly harder than any of the other. Depending on
each person's personality, or the way their brain works, they are good at
doing one or the other.
</li>
<li>Getting good at programming is a matter of showing up, more than about the
"genes".  He repeated quite a few times that he disliked the idea of "baby
hacker", and left out the story of his childhood and college programming
days! I'm totally stealing his idea of meeting every saturday at 1pm, with
a bunch of friends and working until it was 10pm or so, when they could get
cheap beer and food!  And he did this all through his college!  It is
interesting that this idea is so similar to Hacker School!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was a very enjoyable and inspiring talk on the whole.
</p>
</li>
<li>The plan for today is to actually have the parsed information dumped into
some persistent format, and modify the inspect code to actually use it.
</li>
<li>I will also be pairing with Kyle for a few hours on working through some of
  <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book">http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book</a>

Shantanu and I gave a short talk titled "Software Carpentry for
Scientists" for the graduate students of Chemical Engineering
department, IISc, this Friday.  We gave a short introduction to
Git, TDD, Numpy/Scipy, etc and mentioned a few things from Greg
Wilson et al's paper.
</p>

<p>
I promised to revert to them with links to a few resources.  I
figured it would be more beneficial, if I just put it in a
publicly available place.

Here are some very generic (and paraphrased) notes from a short
talk today, by Deepankar Sharma.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Whenever you release a new major version, make sure you keep a
copy of the whole "ecosystem" to be able to run it whenever you
want.  At any point in time, you should be able to run any
version of your software.
</li>
<li>When writing benchmarks/tests/etc., try and ensure that you
cover a broad spectrum of test data, to try and replicate the
different types of data that users could possibly have.
</li>
<li>Don't develop applications with modes.  Be very careful before
you add a new mode to your application, effectively adding one
more code path to maintain.
</li>
<li>(Bonus) Beware of too much extensibility

    <div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
Below is a mail sent by Eric Schulte to the org-mode mailing list
answering a query on how to write elisp for org-mode. I am
reproducing it here, since it is useful advice for me. The actual
thread is here.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
The way that I learned how to program in emacs lisp was mainly
using two commands `elisp-index-search' bound to `C-h e' on my
system, and most importantly `describe-function' bound to `C-h f'.
With `describe-function' you can look at the source code of
functions whose behavior you are familiar with, you can then copy
portions of the code to your <b>scratch</b> buffer where they can be
edited and evaluated with `eval-defun' bound to `C-M-x'.  Now with
Babel, instead of doing this in the scratch buffer you could do
this in emacs-lisp code blocks in an org file, enabling notes and
hierarchical organization – it can be nice to have your noodling
all collected in one file for later reference.
</p>

<p>
If you are going to do any serious work with lisp, I would
emphatically recommend using paredit-mode, and becoming friends
with the Sexp movement functions
</p>

<p>
C-M-f        runs the command paredit-forward
C-M-b        runs the command paredit-backward
C-M-u        runs the command backward-up-list
C-M-k        runs the command kill-sexp
C-y        runs the command yank
</p>

<p>
They allow you to manipulate lisp code on the level of logical
expressions, the utility of which can not be over stated.
</p>

<p>
As for working with Org-mode in particular, I'd recommend looking
at the documentation and source-code of Org-mode functions with
`describe-function', and then looking for how these functions are
actually used in the Org-mode code base with `rgrep'.
</p>

<p>
For a more structured learning experience, I've heard very good
things about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/</a>,
although I haven't used it myself.
</p>

<p>
Hope this helps.  Happy Hacking – Eric
