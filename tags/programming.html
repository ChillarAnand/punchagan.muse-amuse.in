    <p>
I use <a href="http://getnikola.com">Nikola</a> for generating this blog. When creating a new post, it prompts for
a title, and creates a file for the post.
</p>

<p>
Often I'm starting off with only a vague idea that needs to be fleshed out
before it can be published (or discarded). It is quite difficult to come up
with a title at this stage. I just want to start a draft and write things down!
</p>

<p>
I could use a "draft-title" and change it after finishing a post, but this
feels tedious – requires 3 steps – change the title, post filename and post
slug.  The last two steps are optional, really, but I feel they are important
especially when the original title is very different from the new one.
</p>

<p>
Being forced to come up with a title before anything else, feels tedious and,
adds to the effort required to start off a new post.  I shouldn't really be
worrying about the effort required to change the title of an unwritten post,
but it happens subconsciously.
</p>

<p>
To work around this, I now have a "re-title utility" in my editor that takes
care of all the tedious details.  I can start with a random title, like
Draft-1, and change it when I'm done with the post.  I feel this is going to
lead to a lot more drafts, at the very least, if not published posts.
</p>

<p>
Another work-flow related thing I came across recently was @Malabarba's <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1717#issue-150907043">issue</a>
on CIDER (an IDE for Clojure in Emacs).  The <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/getting-started/#Using_the_REPL">REPL</a> takes a while to startup and
this caused him to not use CIDER for running tests, if there wasn't an already
open REPL.
</p>

<p>
The tedium that people feel effects how they use the tool.  Not surprisingly,
making tedious-feeling tasks a breeze with the tool also effects how and how
much they use it.  Subtle variations in a work-flow could make or break it.
How do you discover such potential work-flow make-or-break-ers? I think, these
things would help:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use the tool yourself (dog-food)
</li>
<li>Talk to (or watch!) people using your tool
</li>
<li>Look at work-flows in other similar tools
</li>
<li>Thinking explicitly about various scenarios and simplifying or improving
work-flows
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'd love to hear examples of this, and any ideas or thoughts you may have on
identifying and fixing such things!

I was helping a friend of mine setup <a href="http://jajoosam.github.io">his blog</a> and we were trying to use <a href="http://hexo.io">Hexo</a> –
a static site generator.  We chose a Javascript based tool since he's trying to
learn Javascript.  I skimmed through active Javascript projects in <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net">this list</a>
and finally zeroed down upon Hexo based on its popularity.  I promised to help
my friend to set this up, but he first tried to do it on his own and got back
to me after an hour or so, quite frustrated and almost on the verge of giving
up setting it up.  I didn't expect this from a tool that had so many stars,
forks, plugins and so much active development.
</p>

<p>
We finally got it working, but we found that the error messages were horrendous
– even for someone who has been using free and open-source tools for a while
now.  Printing out errors from compiler or interpreter directly along with the
stack trace is almost always the worst thing to do for a tool/utility (as
opposed to an API or library).  The stack trace is definitely useful, for
developers trying to build upon or improve your tool.  Have a debug or
development mode where developers can get all the information they need.
</p>

<p>
If you care about your users, especially new users, make sure you spend
sufficient time on showing human-readable messages. If possible list the
possible causes for every error along with tips for troubleshooting.

        <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2015</span>
    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
I learnt to use Emacs' profiler yesterday, after many hours of yak-shaving,
trying to get <a href="https://github.com/novoid/Memacs">Memacs</a> working.  Memacs is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">memory extension</a> system for Emacs
written by Karl Voit, that I have been meaning to try out for a long time now.
Seeing lots of review posts at the turn of the year and watching Karl's recent
<a href="http://emacslife.com/emacs-chats/chat-karl-voit.html">Emacs Chat with Sacha Chua</a> pushed me to try and finally set it up.
</p>

<p>
I started writing a <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/Memacs/blob/chrome/memacs/chromium.py">module</a> to create a Memacs file – an org archive file –
from my browser history.  It was pretty easy to write, and I had it spitting
out a huge file with 22k entries after about a couple of hours of work.  Then I
excitedly pulled up my agenda, and turned on the option to view archived
entries, only to be super-disappointed.  It turned out to be extremely slow!
Actually, the agenda never came up with the 22k entries file that I had. At
least not in 5 or so minutes, before I got impatient.  The performance was
unacceptable even when I reduced it to 5k entries.
</p>

<p>
I was pretty sure it wasn't that slow for Karl in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaKPr4J0K2I#t=999">demo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/punchagan/status/550723377871065088">tweeted</a> to him,
asking for a workaround. Meanwhile, I looked at his dot-emacs, but wasn't able
to dig out what was needed to speed up things. He confirmed that his
performance was way better than what I was getting.
</p>

<p>
First, I ruled out the possibility of it being because of the SSD, since
clearly my CPU usage was peaking, and the task was CPU bound and not I/O.
Next, I tried using the same file on a different machine (with a different
version of Emacs and org-mode), and it worked blazingly fast.  So, it was
either the version of Emacs or org-mode that I was using.
</p>

<p>
I should have stopped, thought clearly, and started experimenting with org
version, but hindsight is 20-20.  I tried Ubuntu's pre-built Emacs and agendas
were fast!  I suspected my Emacs build, since I recently started building Emacs
from git.  I built two or three other versions of Emacs, and wasted a lot of
time, before realizing that I wasn't using the org-mode source bundled inside
Emacs for the tests, and there were two "independent" variables.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I began bisecting org-mode's source and found that all hell broke
loose with an <a href="http://orgmode.org/w/?p=org-mode.git;a=commitdiff;h=b88c5464db2cb0d90d4f30e43b5e08d2b1c1fcea;hp=8cc4e09950594b2abec2502e9218318570595ac5">inconspicuous change</a> around release 8.2.6.  It turns out that
org-overview was broken before this, and collapsing all the trees in a newly
opened org-buffer (default option) wasn't working. Once this bug was fixed,
opening huge org files would slow down by a great deal, in turn causing agenda
generation to be unbearably slow.
</p>

<p>
All I had to do was add a <code>#+STARTUP: showeverything</code> to the top of the file.
This speeded up things by about 50 times!  It turns out, I later found out,
that all of this is documented on <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html">Worg</a>. I did try a few search engine queries,
but sadly none of them brought this up.  Adding the following to my config,
speeded up agenda generation by about 150-200 times!
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-agenda-inhibit-startup</span> <span class="no">t</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;; ~50x speedup</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;; 3-4x speedup</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
In the course of all this debugging, I learnt how to use Emacs' profiler.  The
profile reports along with git bisect, eventually helped me figure out what the
problem was.
</p>

<p>
To profile the CPU usage, all you have to do is add a call like
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">profiler-start</span> <span class="ss">'cpu</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1">;; or M-x profiler-start</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
at the place where you wish to start it.  Emacs will then start collecting
information about where time is being spent, by sampling every
<code>sampling-interval</code> seconds (default 10<sup>6</sup> nanoseconds = 1 milli second).
</p>

<p>
You can view the information being collected, at any point of time using
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">profiler-report</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;; or M-x profiler-report</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The report is a nice, interactive tree with the percentage of time spent in
each call. You can stop profiling by calling <code>(profiler-stop)</code>.  If you have
more than one report, you can compare them by hitting <code>=</code> in one of the report
buffers.  I'm definitely going to use this for other things! (like speeding up
my startup?)
</p>

<p>
Now that I have Memacs working with reasonably fast agenda views, I'm looking
forward to collecting as much personal information as I can!  Thanks Karl for
writing Memacs.  I am going to be a pretty heavy user, I think!  There seem to
be a few rough edges, though, and I hope to help smoothen them out a little
bit, over the next few weeks.

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2014</span>
    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
I stumbled on a <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/178-rr-book-club-refactoring-ruby-with-martin-fowler/">Ruby Rogues podcast</a> yesterday, which had <a href="http://martinfowlwer.com">Martin Fowler</a> as the
guest.  I really enjoyed the discussion on Refactoring (the noun, the verb and
the book!)
</p>

<p>
Martin clarified in the podcast that refactoring (the verb/process) is a
sequence of very small refactorings, while you keep making sure that you can
run the test suite always.  A refactoring (noun) is a change where you change
the structure of the code without any externally observable changes, with the
intent of making it easier to understand and cheaper to change in future.
</p>

<p>
I also really liked the metaphor of a 'healthy code base'.  Refactoring is,
then, the process of keeping healthy – exercise, speaking metaphorically.  You
can stack up all the exercise you need to do, until you get really unfit.
Refactoring, similarly, needs to be done regularly, to keep the code base
healthy.  This lets you go faster, in the future.
</p>

<p>
I also really liked the advise about trying to push back the mental contexts
you build, while trying to debug/understand some code that is not very clear,
by refactoring the code to make it clearer.  Code needn't be one big chunk of
cryptographic text.  Code is writing.  It should be clear and understandable.
Or, at least we should strive to make it so!
</p>

<p>
The discussion, as always on this podcast, was very lively, pleasant and
enjoyable! Enjoy!

<li>As preparation for a one-on-one this week with one of the facilitators, I was
wondering if I was really getting better as a programmer, by doing what I am
doing.
</li>
<li>I have heard at numerous places that reading and reflection are keys to
getting better. I feel like I haven't been giving these things much attention
in the past couple of weeks. I don't catch up on reading all the awesome
reading material shared on Zulip and I switched from writing this blog post
first thing in the morning, to any-time-after-lunch. I don't think this
worked out very well. Writing the post worked as a way to reflect on what I
had done yesterday, and what I should be doing today. So, I am back to
writing the blog post, first thing in the morning!
</li>
<li>Yesterday, I worked on indexing the Python sources in a way that the
inspection code can look up, later.  During this process, I found that my
code to use libclang's AST wasn't generic enough, and I had to clean it up to
be able to extract useful information from any file in the <code>cpython</code> sources.
</li>
<li>We also got to attend a super-awesome talk by <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Labnik</a>! He talked about
his progression from being an application developer, to writing libraries, to
working on languages (as a professional developer). He made a lot of
interesting and inspiring points during his talk.  Some of those that stuck
with me are:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>None of these is particularly harder than any of the other. Depending on
each person's personality, or the way their brain works, they are good at
doing one or the other.
</li>
<li>Getting good at programming is a matter of showing up, more than about the
"genes".  He repeated quite a few times that he disliked the idea of "baby
hacker", and left out the story of his childhood and college programming
days! I'm totally stealing his idea of meeting every saturday at 1pm, with
a bunch of friends and working until it was 10pm or so, when they could get
cheap beer and food!  And he did this all through his college!  It is
interesting that this idea is so similar to Hacker School!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was a very enjoyable and inspiring talk on the whole.
</p>
</li>
<li>The plan for today is to actually have the parsed information dumped into
some persistent format, and modify the inspect code to actually use it.
</li>
<li>I will also be pairing with Kyle for a few hours on working through some of
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book">http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book</a>

Shantanu and I gave a short talk titled "Software Carpentry for
Scientists" for the graduate students of Chemical Engineering
department, IISc, this Friday.  We gave a short introduction to
Git, TDD, Numpy/Scipy, etc and mentioned a few things from Greg
Wilson et al's paper.
</p>

<p>
I promised to revert to them with links to a few resources.  I
figured it would be more beneficial, if I just put it in a

Here are some very generic (and paraphrased) notes from a short
talk today, by Deepankar Sharma.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Whenever you release a new major version, make sure you keep a
copy of the whole "ecosystem" to be able to run it whenever you
want.  At any point in time, you should be able to run any
version of your software.
</li>
<li>When writing benchmarks/tests/etc., try and ensure that you
cover a broad spectrum of test data, to try and replicate the
different types of data that users could possibly have.
</li>
<li>Don't develop applications with modes.  Be very careful before
you add a new mode to your application, effectively adding one
more code path to maintain.
</li>
<li>(Bonus) Beware of too much extensibility
</li>

Below is a mail sent by Eric Schulte to the org-mode mailing list
answering a query on how to write elisp for org-mode. I am
reproducing it here, since it is useful advice for me. The actual
thread is here.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
The way that I learned how to program in emacs lisp was mainly
using two commands `elisp-index-search' bound to `C-h e' on my
system, and most importantly `describe-function' bound to `C-h f'.
With `describe-function' you can look at the source code of
functions whose behavior you are familiar with, you can then copy
portions of the code to your <b>scratch</b> buffer where they can be
edited and evaluated with `eval-defun' bound to `C-M-x'.  Now with
Babel, instead of doing this in the scratch buffer you could do
this in emacs-lisp code blocks in an org file, enabling notes and
hierarchical organization – it can be nice to have your noodling
all collected in one file for later reference.
</p>

<p>
If you are going to do any serious work with lisp, I would
emphatically recommend using paredit-mode, and becoming friends
with the Sexp movement functions
</p>

<p>
C-M-f        runs the command paredit-forward
C-M-b        runs the command paredit-backward
C-M-u        runs the command backward-up-list
C-M-k        runs the command kill-sexp
C-y        runs the command yank
</p>

<p>
They allow you to manipulate lisp code on the level of logical
expressions, the utility of which can not be over stated.
</p>

<p>
As for working with Org-mode in particular, I'd recommend looking
at the documentation and source-code of Org-mode functions with
`describe-function', and then looking for how these functions are
actually used in the Org-mode code base with `rgrep'.
</p>

<p>
For a more structured learning experience, I've heard very good
things about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/</a>,
although I haven't used it myself.
</p>

<p>
Hope this helps.  Happy Hacking – Eric
