&lt;li&gt;I spent about an hour in the morning testing out the staging blaggregator
instance, and things seemed to work as expected.  Side note, I got added as a
collaborator on the blaggregator repo!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We worked through the first chapter on getting video working, but we mostly
ended up just copying code rather than actually understanding/carefully
studying it.  I'm not sure how I feel about it, but we got to display fancy
stuff.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wasn't feeling like working on any of my 'old'/'ongoing' projects, and
since Mondays don't feel very productive, I worked on writing a couple of
simple scripts to create twitter lists of HSers, batch wise.

&lt;p&gt;
For the HS API, I just reused some old code I had lying around from my
experiments with the OAuth2 API, though I had to tweak it a little bit to be
able to actually login, using requests. Something about CSRF tokens seems to
have changed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the process, I found that twitter's API isn't very pleasant to use.  Or
may be it's the fact that I was using python twitter client without getting
my own client id/key, but the whole experience of dealing with the twitter
API wasn't a pleasant one at all!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amber, Daria and I also spent about an hour white-boarding some problems from
the Cracking the Code Interview book.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ended up fixing some minor issues with blaggregator and am hoping that the
long pending PR will be merged today.
&lt;/li&gt;
