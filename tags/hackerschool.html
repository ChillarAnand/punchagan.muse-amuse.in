<li>I spent the morning cleaning up the "repr" functions of the diff classes, so
that the diff of functions between two modules can be printed out in a
somewhat meaningful way.

<li>I spent most of the afternoon, preparing to make a small presentation on how
<code>sys.path</code> works in Python.  I thought I didn't do as good a job of it, as I
would've liked, but Tom thought it was not too bad…

<li>Looks like another of those days, where I didn't get much done…  I spent
the evening finishing off <a href="http://craphound.com/homeland/">Homeland</a>. It's a brilliant book, and everyone who
cares about the Government and policies and technology MUST read it!  Thanks

<li>I feel like I didn't get much done yesterday.
</li>
<li>I mostly worked on the API differ, but didn't get much done.  I have a few
tests, and some code for diffing two functions, but I'm not very happy with
it.
</li>
<li>I helped Giorgio and Carlos with using my client only <code>hs_oauth</code>
script/library, for their Zulip bot.
</li>
<li>The white boarding group worked on some binary related problems, and it was
fun.
</li>
<li>I looked at how the HS OAuth backend works on blaggregator and thought about
how to go about fixing the issue of broken images on the site.  The problem
happens because the image URLs are returned from the HS API calls, that are
made whenever a user logs in(?), and the URLs are cached.  Since, HS uses
cloudfront for its assets, the URLs expire after a period of time, and the
cached urls in blag's database need to be updated.  There could be two ways
of doing it -
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Check if the URL 404s, every time a URL is requested, on the server side.
</li>
<li>Do it on the client side, with some javascript magic.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Intuitively, I feel like 2. would be better, but Madhu suggested
that 1. wouldn't be that bad either.  We could try both out, and see which
works better I suppose.
</p>

<p>
I'd be interested to try this out, sometime.

the list of public API changes in a library you use, to estimate the cost of
updating to the newer version, without having to manually go through all the

<li>I spent about an hour in the morning testing out the staging blaggregator
instance, and things seemed to work as expected.  Side note, I got added as a
collaborator on the blaggregator repo!
</li>
<li>We worked through the first chapter on getting video working, but we mostly
ended up just copying code rather than actually understanding/carefully
studying it.  I'm not sure how I feel about it, but we got to display fancy
stuff.
</li>
<li>I wasn't feeling like working on any of my 'old'/'ongoing' projects, and
since Mondays don't feel very productive, I worked on writing a couple of
simple scripts to create twitter lists of HSers, batch wise.

<p>
For the HS API, I just reused some old code I had lying around from my
experiments with the OAuth2 API, though I had to tweak it a little bit to be
able to actually login, using requests. Something about CSRF tokens seems to
have changed.
</p>

<p>
In the process, I found that twitter's API isn't very pleasant to use.  Or
may be it's the fact that I was using python twitter client without getting
my own client id/key, but the whole experience of dealing with the twitter
API wasn't a pleasant one at all!
</p>
</li>
<li>Amber, Daria and I also spent about an hour white-boarding some problems from
the Cracking the Code Interview book.
</li>
<li>I ended up fixing some minor issues with blaggregator and am hoping that the
long pending PR will be merged today.

<li>I spent the Saturday revamping my Emacs config.  The main issue with my
config was having a "package" list, of all the packages that the
configuration uses, in case we are trying to duplicate it elsewhere.  I
noticed that this gets out of sync, because I install packages by hand and
never update this list.  I wrote up <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/user-lisp/setup-defuns.el">some code</a>, that keeps this list in sync
with all the packages I have installed.  I configured el-get to play well

some matching/searching features with helm/ido/whatever else.

right now… though I'm not sure if it would work very well, with the pi's

super fun!

some C code, but didn't really find anything other than documentation… I
guess, I should pick a module and look for bugs in it, instead.

last names of people or link to them, for privacy reasons.  Hacker School is
particularly careful about not divulging information about who are at Hacker

coffee with her, and I chatted with her briefly. She encouraged me to try and
send a patch to CPython, that involved debugging and fixing some C issues.

<li>I spent some time with Tom, while he tried to get <code>cinspect</code> working for him,
and it seemed like having the developer next to you, helped.  As always.  We
didn't make any fixes to the code, but it worked.

<li>Later, I paired with Sophia for an hour to refactor the vcs code. It's

<li>It turned out that the SPI driver exposed a faster way to write bits, writing
to all the LEDs at once, instead of one at a time, and this was sufficient to
get things working!

<li>Kyle and I started to have enough, of the glowing LEDs and decided to wrap up
the project, but, Nick had different ideas for us! We had talked about having
the music stream via airplay, but Nick got his DJing tools, and it would be
too bad to not use it for the party, but doing that meant Airplay's delay
wouldn't help the DJ. So, we connected a line-in, and thought we'd be done if
we just read the input and used that data. But, it turns out that's not so
simple because sending data over the wire, added noise to it, and in a whole
range of frequencies! I tried removing all the fourier coefficients which
were lower than a threshold, but I felt like it didn't work very well, until
Nick reduced the gain of this output on the amp to the very minimum. Finally,
Kyle and I decided that this was good enough for the party!

<li>I also hacked up a quick script to read a font file, and use the grey values
to get ascii characters to show up on the LED strip.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mel's talk in the morning was brilliant!  I wonder why it's not a part of
recommended reading for Hacker Schoolers, or referred to, in the manual.
</li>
<li>Logically, it makes sense that Mel came now, so that she didn't have to come
twice to talk to the firsts and seconds, but it would have been great to have
had this talk in the first week of Hacker School!
</li>
<li>Mel gave us a lot of new information and insights into education and learning
styles. I also like the fact that she gave us all a good vocabulary to think
about and discuss stuff related to learning. I will try to think, and apply
as much of this as I can, for the rest of my time here.
</li>
<li>She talked about <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2014/02/10/test-driven-learning-setting-learning-goals-for-yourself-software-engineering-edition/">test driven learning</a> which seemed very interesting. Instead
of just saying, "wow that would be an interesting thing to do", stop for a
moment, think about what you are trying to learn, and how you will assess if
you have learnt what you wanted to, and then dive into the project.
</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html">learning styles</a> workshop was pretty good too, though I feel like I don't
know myself well enough, and I unable to properly "bucket" myself.  Later, I
took a <a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html">quiz</a>, and ended up fairly close to the middle, in all the dimensions.
</li>
<li>Mel introduced us to the idea of <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/201816780/A-Cognitive-Apprenticeship-Primer">cognitive apprenticeship</a>, and encouraged us
to try out the different modes when pairing. I really liked the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development">Zone
of proximal development</a> and I will try to take the advice of spending most of
the rest of my time here in this zone.
</li>
<li>Do I (really) care?  Motivation and mindset, …
</li>
<li>Be courageous!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I was trying to wrap libshairport and use it on the RPi to be able to listen
to songs being streamed on Airplay, and use that data to drive the LEDs.
</li>
<li>Shairport, a tool written in C seemed to work.  My attempts to wrap
<code>libshairport</code>, which is a fork of <code>shairport</code> converting it into a library,
failed miserably.
</li>
<li>The trouble was essentially getting Airplay to discover my service.  I tried
a bunch of things with <code>pybonjour</code> and <code>avahi</code>, but wasn't able to get it
right.
</li>
<li>Finally, I tried just announcing the service with <code>shairport</code>, and actually
running a python script that wraps <code>libshairport</code> to listen to the data.
But, this didn't work and iTunes complained that this Airplay device is not
compatible. Before going much further with this, I found <code>shairplay</code> which is
a tool similar to <code>shairport</code>, but came with a library, and also Python
bindings!  I happily used this to get stuff working!

<li>I'm interested to see today, what exactly I was missing yesterday!

<li>I spent most of the day looking at shairport, and libshairport and trying to
wrap it, so I can use it to get data for the spectrum analyzer via the
Air-play protocol.  I was able to call it using <code>ctypes</code>, but it doesn't seem
discoverable.

<li>I also briefly looked at Julia and <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org">dwm</a>, to try and port dwm to Julia.  It
doesn't seem like too much work, but is going to take me a while given how
comfortable I'm with both Julia and C.

<li>Yaron Minsky's talk on distributed systems was a great introduction to

<li>During the weekend, I had this idea of building a personalized "radio" for
myself using a Raspberry pi.  The idea is to have a service where all my
bookmarks, and feeds are accumulated to, instead of eating up valuable
browser tab real estate.  And then, I could use a Raspberry pi to randomly
play content off of it, based on a theme.
</li>

<li>I worked on getting things together for it, during the weekend.  The project
is more like a "thing that needs to be done", rather than something that puts
me out of my comfort zone, atleast as far as I can see. So, I'm just going to
work on it as a background thing, between other projects, etc.
</li>

<li>Festival seemed OK initially, while I was trying things out, but when I
actually used it to read me a blog post, it was really terrible!  I tried
demos of a few commercial tools, and they seem much better than what festival
had to offer.  I wonder what it would take to get Festival, up there.  I
tried using Google's translate service's tts (unofficial API) and it seemed
so good!  But, it limits each request to 100 bytes, and the audio will have
to be downloaded via the Network.
</li>

<li>Madhu pointed me to MaryTTS, which seemed to be an active project and it
seemed to be much better than Festival, though not as good as Google's tts.
I'm going to try getting it to run on a Pi, next.

will probably work more on tweaking it, to get it to work the way we want
it, for the party!

<li>I also did a little bit of Julia with Sean, and it was fun.  I may try
playing around with it, a little bit, but not sure what to work on.  May be
continue working through the think-complexity book using Julia?

<li>Or jump into something I totally don't know about, inspired by listening to
Julia Evans' podcast for Ruby Rogues.  I just got this idea of trying to
write a window manager to understand how X works, and what wayland is…  I
could try porting dwm or i3wm to Julia.

<li>Kyle and I did a demo of our spectrum analyzer/visualizer during the
presenations.  It was fun to work on, though we mostly just followed a
tutorial on the web, and made use of a bunch of libraries.
</li>
<li>I spent the night in HackerSchool.
</li>
<li>I was cleaning up the code in the tutorial we were trying to follow.
</li>
<li>Also, cleaned up the install.sh used by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/togiles/lightshowpi/src">lightshowpi</a> project to not do all the
ugly sudo setups, and use a Python virtualenv and install into that.
</li>
<li>Refactored the ugly looking music part of the tutorial into a smaller script
with only the functionality that we were going to use.
</li>
<li>We hit an interesting bug that would light up all the LEDs on the strip, once
in a while.  I didn't notice it during the night, because I had a "decay"
factor (the max factor by which the height of the columns should get reduced
between successive updates) was 0.9, but when the decay factor was reduced to
a lower value, it would happen quite often.  Also, we didn't see this
happening before.  So, we thought the bug was in the code I had written, when
I should have been sleeping. After reading and debugging my code for a bit,
with Kyle and Sean, I thought it was something hardware related that we were
doing wrong.  But, it turns out that a library we were using lit-up the whole
strip, when start and end values were both zero, instead of not lighting up
anything!
</li>
<li>Also, we hit another off-by one error, just before the demo. I didn't do the
math for splitting the strip into columns too carefully, and we hadn't
noticed the off-by one error until we taped up the strip into different
columns on a pillar for demo.
</li>
<li>There were some cool presentations by others.  I'll update the list on
Monday, since I currently don't remember them all!  Looking at the list of
names on the registration sheet would help!

<li>Started pairing with Kyle on his idea of building a spectrum analyzer on the

spent the morning, setting it up, and stepping through steps in <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-spectrum-analyzer-display-on-rgb-led-strip">this tutorial</a>.
</li>
<li>The tutorial, I felt, wasn't very well written, and definitely not suitable
for absolute beginners to start with.
</li>
<li>The code didn't seem to work for us, too.  The project put together a bunch
of libraries, in a way that someone who knew their way could follow along.
</li>
<li>Dana helped us and explained many things, about differences between SPI/GPIO,
and the precautions to take, helped us hook up stuff, etc.  It was great to
have her stepping in an helping every now and then!
</li>
<li>While Kyle was pairing on an Alum, I worked through the Graph Theory chapter
in the Think Complexity book, and read about the abrupt changes of
characteristics in random graphs, that were very similar and related to the
phenomenon in percolation theory that Nava explained.

<li>Later in the day, I played around with the python-googlevoice API, that
someone laboriously wrote after lot of careful html/xml parsing.

<li>I spent the night, refactoring the code to display random data on the

<li>Micheal demo-ed paredit mode in the emacs-club meetup, and I learnt a bunch
of things I didn't know about it.
</li>
<li>I added simpler tests (just one test, really) for <code>cinspect</code> using a dummy
module, and Tom started reviewing the code.  I wrapped up the code (for now),
until there is further interest in the project (in the form of issues/feature
requests).  I haven't yet announced it anywhere, but I probably should.
</li>
<li>I helped Teja (a friend of mine, not in HS) with a simple function to use
bisection to solve an equation.  He's just starting off with Python, and am
looking forward to see where he goes with it!
</li>
<li>I learned a few things about the V8 code base, thanks to sitting next to
Marcus, who is poking around with it.
</li>
<li>I started looking for other things to do, and went through a little bit of
the Audio programming book, but didn't do it for too long, until I stumbled
on <a href="http://greenteapress.com/complexity/">Think Complexity</a> and started reading it.  I read the introduction, and got
through a few of the exercises on Graphs.
</li>
<li>I also played around Flask-Sockets to help figure out answers to some
questions on Zulip, and was able to get a <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/53600958c1799c2dcf26">Hello World</a> working.
</li>
<li>In the process, I discovered the awesomeness of the gist-mode in emacs.  I
had always wanted gist plugins to let me list and update my previous gists,
but most of the plugins didn't seem to have it, or the feature wasn't very
discoverable.  I had tried writing something like that for Canopy, one or two
years ago.  Discovering that gist mode has this feature, was awesome!

<li>I didn't spend much time at Hacker School on Friday.  I reached a bit late
for the start of "Recursion day", and did a few problems.  The problems were
simple, but interesting.  After lunch, I headed home to start to Philly.
</li>
<li>Later in the day, I did some refactoring of the code to have the index reader
and writer split out.
</li>
<li>I also added a setup.py to be able to install the package using the standard
tools instead of PYTHONPATH hacks and stuff.
</li>
<li>During the refactoring, I again hit <i>this bug</i>.  I found out from Pankaj that
he has <code>from __future__ import print_function, absolute_imports</code> at the start
of his files these days.  I think I'm going to do it, too.

<li>Unicode issues: it turned out that (atleast) one of the files had a character
that wasn't UTF-8 encoded. I got around it by trying 'utf-8', if not falling
back to 'iso-8859-1'.  Now that I think about it, I should fallback to
'utf-8' with replace, if that doesn't work either.
</li>
<li>I did a little clean up on the way the indexes were stored, to be able to
have a <code>getfile</code>, to mimic <code>inspect</code>'s API.
</li>
<li>I also "improved" the IPython startup script to monkey-patch the source code
formatter/colorizer to not break with C modules.

<li>The one-on-one with Allison was pretty useful, and I feel a little more
relaxed now.

<li>As preparation for a one-on-one this week with one of the facilitators, I was
wondering if I was really getting better as a programmer, by doing what I am
doing.
</li>
<li>I have heard at numerous places that reading and reflection are keys to
getting better. I feel like I haven't been giving these things much attention
in the past couple of weeks. I don't catch up on reading all the awesome
reading material shared on Zulip and I switched from writing this blog post
first thing in the morning, to any-time-after-lunch. I don't think this
worked out very well. Writing the post worked as a way to reflect on what I
had done yesterday, and what I should be doing today. So, I am back to
writing the blog post, first thing in the morning!
</li>
<li>Yesterday, I worked on indexing the Python sources in a way that the
inspection code can look up, later.  During this process, I found that my
code to use libclang's AST wasn't generic enough, and I had to clean it up to
be able to extract useful information from any file in the <code>cpython</code> sources.
</li>
<li>We also got to attend a super-awesome talk by <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Labnik</a>! He talked about
his progression from being an application developer, to writing libraries, to
working on languages (as a professional developer). He made a lot of
interesting and inspiring points during his talk.  Some of those that stuck
with me are:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>None of these is particularly harder than any of the other. Depending on
each person's personality, or the way their brain works, they are good at
doing one or the other.
</li>
<li>Getting good at programming is a matter of showing up, more than about the
"genes".  He repeated quite a few times that he disliked the idea of "baby
hacker", and left out the story of his childhood and college programming
days! I'm totally stealing his idea of meeting every saturday at 1pm, with
a bunch of friends and working until it was 10pm or so, when they could get
cheap beer and food!  And he did this all through his college!  It is
interesting that this idea is so similar to Hacker School!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was a very enjoyable and inspiring talk on the whole.
</p>
</li>
<li>The plan for today is to actually have the parsed information dumped into
some persistent format, and modify the inspect code to actually use it.
</li>
<li>I will also be pairing with Kyle for a few hours on working through some of

I took it easy during the weekend, and went on a nice camp with my a cousin's
family to TobyHanna State Park for a day or so, and spent the remaining (long)
weekend at their place in PA.  It was a pretty nice break!
</p>

<p>
Yesterday evening, I talked to Madhu about how ugly my code looked while I was
trying to use <code>libclang</code>, and he told me that he found a lot of wrapped C++/C
libraries end up being that way, and I also realized that using the Python AST
library seemed much cleaner, because it just contained Python objects, but
representing C/C++ objects in an AST and interacting with them in Python, isn't
that clean.
</p>

<p>
I cleaned up my code, and removed all the ugly regexes to use libclang to do
the parsing of the libs, and get the source code.  I basically got all the
tests passing, but they were taking an order of magnitude longer to run.  So, I
guess the next step is to cache things somehow.
</p>

<p>
I also added support for viewing the sources of built-in types.  It was pretty
simple, once I had everything working with libclang.

<li>I played around with Clang for a bit, to try and use libclang to parse the C
code for inspection, instead of writing one myself.  It sometimes feels like
an overkill, but it feels like it'll make the whole code more robust.  I'm
not sure.  I'll need to play around for a bit more to decide.
</li>
<li>I also finally got around to fix the resolution of my tty shells.  I was in a
bus, and wanted my laptop's battery to last longer, and decided to use a tty
shell with just emacs running. But, the resolution sucked.  So, I
fixed. Essentially it involved removing a blacklist file that an old version
of Nvidia drivers left behind in
<code>/usr/share/grub-gfxpayload-lists/blacklist/</code> and setting
<code>GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080</code> in <code>/etc/default/grub</code>.
</li>
<li>Later in the evening I also bought the domain <code>octo.cat</code>, given there were a
bunch of people buying cat domains, and talking about it on Zulip!

<li>This Friday we worked on building our own URL shorteners.  It was a fun
exercise, and I built one that is not persistent, in the two hours.  I worked
on a not so important problem of having sorted query parameters, instead of
the more important problem of having a persistent server.  Anyway, I should
be building something that works, first, before trying to solve the more
interesting problems.  At least on Fridays.

<li>I watched this old but interesting talk by Brandon Rhodes, titled <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/276/the-mighty-dictionary-55">The Mighty

<li>I like how some of the people here are taking check-ins so seriously.  A
bunch of people posted messages on Zulip, informing that they would not be
able to make it to check-ins, and seemed quite sorry about it.
</li>
<li>Check-ins are indeed useful.  At the end of every day, I review my work
wondering what I did, and sometimes end up pushing myself harder, to have
something reasonable to talk about during the check-ins!
</li>
<li>Yesterday, I read up about FFTs and ended up playing around with <code>fft</code> in
  <code>scipy</code>, and played around with audacity, etc.  Nothing concrete, really.
</li>
<li>There was a "goals" workshop by Stacey, where she talked about how to get the
most out of this batch of Hacker School, and then we split into groups of 3,
and presented our goal-statements to each other, and gave our impressions of
each others' goals.
</li>
<li>I didn't really have a goal, but the exercise seemed to help, anyway.
</li>
<li>Also, I think it is making me nervous to treat Hacker School as
super-important.  It is important to make the best use of every hour, every
minute here, but at the same time, I shouldn't be constantly worrying about
whether or not, whatever I'm doing is the best use of my time here.
</li>
<li>I think I would like to form some good habits, and make a few good friends,
more than finish projects and build something uber-cool.  Of course, it would
be great to build awesome stuff (and may be the only reasonable way to form
habits, and make friends) but I shouldn't worry too much about time running
out. Never Graduate!

<li>I worked for the whole day on implementing <i>an algorithm</i> to analyze a
cipher text, and guess the substitution cipher used.  The algorithm
was pretty straight forward, and I had it "mostly" working, in a
couple of hours.
</li>
<li>I then began to refactor it, and found that there was what looked
like a bug, and I "fixed" it mindlessly.  I was essentially trying
to swap 2 rows, and columns of a pandas data frame.  I had a
data-frame <code>D</code> and its copy <code>D_</code>.  I was trying to swap 2 rows and
columns of <code>D_</code>.  I found that the code was initially using the data
from <code>D</code> to do the swap.  To fix it, I checked if tuple unpacking
did the right thing.  It looked like it did.  So, I used something
like <code>_D['a'], D_['b'] = D_['b'], D_['a']</code>.  Essentially, changed <code>D</code>
on the right hand side to <code>D_</code>.  I thought I had tested this on the
terminal, but after hours of debugging (along with fixing another
minor issue), I later found out that the tuple unpacking doesn't
work and the swapped rows and columns actually become equal!  I had
suspected this initially, and had "tested" this manually, I
thought.  These are the kinds of things that should have tests for,
I think.  It wouldn't have taken me too long to write a test, and I
could have been totally sure that it works!  (I was manually reading
off values in the array, and probably messed up somewhere)

<p>
FWIW, the code now reads <code>_D['a'], D_['b'] = D_['b'].copy(),
  D_['a'].copy()</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>The algo seems to need about 1000 characters to get past the 90%
accuracy mark.  I could probably tweak it a little to perform
better, but I'm going to leave it here, for now, and move on to the
signal processing parts.  I'm not totally sure how the signal
processing would work, and whether we could actually map back the
keystrokes to a substitution cipher enciphered text.
</li>
<li>If required, the tweaks could be -
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use trigrams instead of bigrams
</li>
<li>Add a degree of dictionary look-ups: May be something like,
look-up all the deciphered words, and try not swapping the
characters that appear in most of the words that are in the
dictionary.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This paper is 20 years old, and there would surely be work by others
building on top of this, or doing it totally differently.

<li>The Apprenticeship patterns book is very interesting!  I shall
continue to read it and start create daily/weekly rituals from the
actions prescribed in the book!
</li>
<li>I was reading <a href="http://blogs.collab.net/git/protect-git-history#.U6fixh-caV4">this post</a> on <code>git gc</code>, <code>reflog</code>, etc. and wanted to
see what the default values were for some of the configurable
variables.  But, the git config command didn't help.  Developer/code
defaults are also a part of the "config" system, and any tools to
inspect config variables should display them, if no other values
have been set explicitly!

<li>"If experience is built upon failure as much as success, then you
need a more or less private space where you can seek out failure."
– Apprenticeship Patterns.
</li>
<li>Our check-in groups changed, but 3 of us from our last check-in
group are together again!
</li>
<li>Most of the day was spent with Git.  In the morning, I learned that
setting <code>push.default</code> to <code>nothing</code> will prevent pushing any
branches without specifying explicitly which branch I want to push.
</li>
<li>Also, later in the day, Alan gave a presentation mapping the
internals of git to the commands, trying to give everyone a better
mental model of Git.
</li>
<li>I spent some time trying to get <code>jedi</code> integration for <code>emacs</code>. It
should've worked out of the box, but I'm not sure the ELPA
repositories have proper dependency/version management.  Seems to be
the problem, everywhere!  Dependencies of a package get updated, and
the package starts acting up…
</li>
<li>Chaitu sent me a link about solving mazes using Finite Automata, and
I spent some time trying to write a simple solver, and compare it
with Nava's breadth first search.  But, it looks like we broke her
code during the refactor.  I may get back to this, at some point.
</li>
<li>I also spent a few minutes talking to Kyle, while he was trying to
implement a simple version of the NTP protocol.  The algorithm it
turns out, is pretty simple.
</li>
<li>I started reading a little bit on crypt-analysis for Simple
Substitution ciphers, and I'll try implementing one of the
algorithms today.
</li>
<li>The day ended with yummy pizza and video watching!  We watched –

<li>I spent most of Saturday, thinking about what I should be doing for
the next few weeks, and what I really want to get out of Hacker
School.

<li>I had a good discussion with Naren about things that he works on,
and the kind of things that he sees as hard, what kind of things
interest me, and what I want to do post Hacker School.  I always
knew, I didn't really have an area of expertise or an area that I'm
super interested in, where I want to work.  This discussion only was
a verbalizing of those thoughts.
</li>
<li>I am not sure, I am very happy with the way I have been learning
Haskell.  The UPenn course has been reasonably good with the
exercises provided, and I have been learning through "pseudo"
projects.  But, I'm wondering if I should pick up a more concrete
project.
</li>
<li>I played around a little bit with Elm and started something to try
and write <a href="https://github.com/huckerdom/layout">Layout</a> using Elm.
</li>
<li>I tried cleaning up the phonebook problem from Friday. It works, but
can definitely be improved with some help from a more experienced

<li>I finished parts of the phonebook task today.  The code looks ugly,
and very un-haskelly.  I asked for feedback on it, but I guess its
just too ugly for anyone to take the time out to comment on it, and
help me improve it.
</li>
<li>I also tried to read up about Monads, and worked through exercises
from a few different places.  I haven't yet finished the exercises
in Chapter 12 of the UPenn course.  I just looked at them today, and
they seem like a complete bouncer at first glance.
</li>
<li>I went on a really long walk with Naren, and food-hopped with him
while he was telling me stories about the various places he worked
at and the kinds of things he has been working on, and things he
liked and disliked about them.  It has been a good weekend to spend
with Naren!
</li>
<li>Also, the long walk and talking to Chaitu cleared my head a bit, and
I decided to pause the Haskell tutorials and learning for the next
couple of weeks.  I don't really have a project that needs me to
learn Haskell, right now.  I should stick to project and need based
learning, which I enjoy the most.
</li>
<li>Right now, I feel like working on an key stroke acoustic emanation
based key-logger.  Just before applying to Hacker School, I came
across the idea of side-channel attacks, and it sounded pretty
exciting.  I don't intend to snoop onto anybody, but the project
seems to be challenging enough, and I will have quite a bit to learn
about. It will involve signal processing, and learning – both areas
that I have seemed interesting to me for long, but I haven't really
done anything in them.  I plan to work on the idea for a couple of
weeks, and review my progress and chart my future course. The
problem appears to have 2 parts to it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Processing audio, and extracting key-strokes from it.
</li>
<li>Identifying the text, based on a sequence of key-strokes. Though,
in reality each press of a key may not sound the same, for a start
assuming we are able to accurately get a sequence of key-strokes,
the problem would reduce to solving a simple substitution cipher.
I plan to start with this, tomorrow.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, I plan to hang out a lot more with Hacker Schoolers, and let
myself be distracted a lot more by random discussions and
activities, than I have allowed myself to be, in the past few weeks.
I should be writing as much code as I can, while I'm here.  But, I
should also be rubbing elbows with the awesome folks, which I will
only be able to virtually, once I'm out of here.
</li>
<li>Thanks to Amber, I also came across this interesting looking book
called <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813">Apprenticeship patterns</a>.  I plan to read it over the next
week or two.
</li>
<li>I haven't been playing almost any Ultimate here. I atleast need to
work out a conditioning and throwing practice schedule and start
working on it, early next week.  Tomorrow won't work since it's 5am
and I'm still awake!
</li>
<li>I also probably need to get enough sleep!
</li>
<li>Looking forward to the next couple of weeks!

<h2 id="sec-1">Motivation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I was trying to pair on writing a simple app that uses Hacker
School's OAuth2 API, and hit a roadblock on the first step of
requesting an authorization from the user.  Once the user authorized
my app, I would see an error that said, "The authorization server
does not support this response type".  I was using a client library
that I had <a href="https://github.com/litl/rauth">used before</a>, and the server was using a what seemed like
a <a href="https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper">popular implementation</a> for ruby on rails.  Getting weird errors is
not done!
</p>

<p>
I have used OAuth2 based authentication <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/statiki/blob/master/statiki.py#L49">before</a>, but the thought of
using it always makes me a little nervous, just because
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I don't understand it very well.
</li>
<li>Like almost everything else, there seem to be so many libraries
for doing this in Python, and I'm never sure which one to use, or
which one I used the last time around.  Not understanding the
protocol also doesn't let me debug anything that comes up.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To fix this, I set about to read and understand the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth2 protocol</a>.
This blog post is an attempt to record it for future reference, and
possibly act as a reference for others.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Why OAuth</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
OAuth is simply a way for an end-user to allow third parties to use
protected data, without sharing the user's credentials with the
third-party.
</p>

<p>
For example, an end-user (Jane) can grant a printing service
(Printo) access to her protected photos stored at a photo-sharing
service (Picasa), without sharing her username and password with the
printing service.  Instead, she authenticates directly with a server
trusted by the photo-sharing service, which issues the printing
service delegation-specific credentials. (example from the OAuth 2.0
spec)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Protocol Flow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<img src="/images/536281e1af42c5729864722aa6e9019ef9e93c0a.png">


<p>
The flow occurs through a sequence of user actions, client requests
and user-agent (browser) redirects.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(A) Printo asks Jane to allow using Picasa Data. The request can
be sent directly to Jane, but is usually routed via
Picasa/Google.
</li>

<li>(B) Printo gets back an authorization grant, which is a
credential representing Jane's authorization or approval.  The
type of the actual grant credential depends on the type of
request that Printo used.
</li>

<li>(C, D) Printo gets back to Google with the credentials it obtained
in the previous step and obtains a token that it can use to talk
with Picasa.
</li>

<li>(E, F) Printo asks for the desired photo with the token it
obtained previously, and Picasa gives back the photo to print.
Jane gets her framed photo!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
But before any of this happens, the client needs to register with
the authorization server and obtain a <code>client_id</code> and
<code>client_secret</code>, that will be used to identify the client making
the requests.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Pythonized "authorization code" work-flow.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The OAuth2 spec allows the authorization request/grant to be of 4
different types.  It also allows some flexibility in the token
type.
</p>

<p>
In my experience, the most common work-flow seems to be using an
<i>authorization code</i> as an authorization grant, and using a <i>Bearer</i>
type token.  This work-flow is explained in the diagram below (taken
from the spec document).  This diagram zooms in, onto the steps A-D
in the diagram above.

<p>
This <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/76e8771fc26cd243f3ac">python code snippet</a> is a simple implementation of this
workflow, using the Hacker School API.

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
I think, I understand the OAuth2 spec a lot better now, and hope
that this will help others understand it, too.  And more
importantly, I won't get nervous when I have to add it to my
projects.
</p>

<p>
Also, <a href="https://github.com/idan/oauthlib">oauthlib</a> for Python seems to be a pretty thorough
implementation of the spec, and <a href="https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib">requests-oauthlib</a> seems to wrap it
for use with requests.  I think I'm going to use this in my future
projects.

<li>Yesterday was a bit more wandering than usual.  I still have to
finish (actually, start) the last chapter in the UPenn course
(Monads).  I hope to finish it during the weekend.
</li>

<li>I started with reading <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia">Typeclassopedia</a>, in the hope of getting
comfortable with Functors and Applicatives and to get introduced to
Monads.  But, I got distracted before I got to the end of the part
on Functors.
</li>

<li>During the check-ins, Laura and Denise mentioned that they are both
facing problems with OAuth, and would like to pair on it.  I decided
to join them, since I've had reasonable luck with OAuth, though I
knew I didn't understand it very well.  While they were working on
getting it to work on OSX, I was trying to write a simple Python
example to do it, and was getting a weird error about the
<code>response_type</code> being not supported.  I was using <a href="https://github.com/litl/rauth">rauth</a> in a way
very similar to what I had done for <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/statiki/blob/master/statiki.py#L49">statiki</a> but the Hacker School
API server wasn't letting me through.  I could debug it only a
little before lunch, and a little bit after lunch.  And realized
that the <code>response_type</code> had to be one of <code>code</code> or <code>token</code> and not
<code>json</code> or <code>empty</code>.  But this is a required parameter, and I expected
<code>rauth</code> to do the right thing!  I got back to it at the end of the
day, and went through the RFC for OAuth2 and wrote up a simple
Python script to implement the whole thing, without using any 3rd
party oauth libraries.  I think I understand the whole thing much
better now, and will soon write up a blog post on it.
</li>

<li>I spent about an hour or so on reviewing Nava's code (along with
Tom, Amber and Patricia), that generated and solved mazes. We tried
to make small incremental changes to her code, and improve it,
hopefully giving her a sense of how to make the code more
intentional.
</li>

<li>Thursday evening presentations! People here have been working on
such cool stuff!  Maze solvers and percolation probability
calculators, phone gap based mobile applications, a cool Midi based
music generator, an <a href="https://github.com/mveytsman/emm-ess-pee">emulator</a> for MSP430 in Clojure, an event logger
in ObjectiveC that can log to a web server and can be used by
multiple clients to debug communication related issues, a HTTP
server written from Scratch, a web server in Swift, a pattern
matching based library in js, a heuristics based puzzle solver, and
a web editor for jekyll!  Holy cow!  These presentations are
extremely inspiring and will probably be the thing I look forward to
the most, for the next 10 weeks.

an easy way to send stuff on to my kindle. (pdfs, html, etc.).
Instapaper works, but doesn't work as well as I would like it to.  I

involve too much, except I wasted a lot of time on tracking a
stupidity of mine.

<li>The next part of the course was an introduction to Functors,
Applicative and Alternative.  I'm not sure I totally understand and

exercises.

<li>I think it's time for me to start working on some Elm tutorials,

and incidentally found <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids#the-newtype-keyword">this section</a> that ended with the following
summary: "If you just want your type signatures to look cleaner and
be more descriptive, you probably want <code>type</code> synonyms. If you want
to take an existing type and wrap it in a new type in order to make
it an instance of a type class, chances are you're looking for a
<code>newtype</code>.  And if you want to make something completely new, odds
are good that you're looking for the <code>data</code> keyword."

</li>
<li>I was working on Monoids for most part of the day and got through
exercise 7.  I started doing the I/O exercise around the end of the
day.
</li>
<li>The day ended with a talk on jobs related stuff by Nick and Sonali.
It seems super unlikely for me to get a job (in the US), from what I
understood from them.  So, I needn't worry too much about that and
focus on getting better at Haskel and as a programmer in general.

<li>I spent an hour or so to clean up by blog workflow and help scripts

<li>lolcommit is an interesting project, and Max is using it for logging
his work at Hacker School.

<li>Learned about laziness and the consequences of it. You cannot have
side-effects, in a lazy language, if you want to keep the sanity of
the developers using your language.
</li>
<li>Pattern matching forces evaluation.
</li>
<li>Also, briefly read about <code>seq</code>, halting problem and <code>bottom</code> from
the Haskell wiki.

<li>The week ended with presentations by Hacker Schoolers from this
batch.  It was also Alum day, so we had some Alumni visiting.  I
missed half of the presentations because I had to leave early for
Suguna's graduation.

<p>
I hope to continue to do some work on the tutorials during the
weekend, and get back to it and finish them next week.

I came super early to try and get some work done in the quiet before
the daily checkins time.  Continued with the Haskell tutorial and
reading the Real World Haskell.
</p>

<p>
Finished a couple of exercises from the UPenn course, that were pretty
straight forward.
</p>

<p>
Also, finished a few exercises from chapter 3 of real world haskell,
and partially finished implementing Graham scan for generating a
convex hull for a set of points.
</p>

<p>
The exercises from both the places involved mainly learning about
Algebraic Data Types.
</p>

<p>
Mary pinged me to ask how the first couple of days were, and it was
good to talk to get a ping from her though I never talked to her.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to continue working on the Haskell exercises today.
</p>

<p>
I also got a couple of ideas for small projects:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since, yelp is blocked from here, nobody can use yelp's API and work
on any projects.  It may be helpful to have an API proxy server that
runs on a different server and forwards any requests coming to it.
</li>
<li>A simple script to create a twitter list for each batch of
Hacker School.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Doing them in Python would be pretty straight forward. I will try to
work on these things in Haskell, once I'm reasonably comfortable with
Haskell.

Finally, I'm at Hacker School.  The day began with introductions,
breakfast and welcomes to HackerSchool.
</p>

<p>
The four rules of Hacker School were reiterated to all of us:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No (Feigning) surprise
</li>
<li>No Well-actuallys
</li>
<li>No Backseat driving
</li>
<li>No Subtle-isms
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It was made clear that each of us should watch ourselves not to break
these rules, and being called on breaking these rules is totally cool,
and we should stop about it and think for a moment and move-on.
Breaking the rules doesn't make us bad hacker schoolers.  We are all
here to learn!
</p>

<p>
I liked the idea of all of us being asked to list out the things that
we are nervous about, and excited about.  I was happy to find that a
lot of the people were nervous about the similar kinds of things I was
nervous about.  I'm not alone!
</p>

<p>
After the check-ins, I started off with the Introduction to <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/">Haskell course</a> by
<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/">Brent Yorgey</a>.  What I did was mostly a recap of what I learned from the first
few chapters of <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">Learn you a Haskell</a>.  I learnt about how credit card numbers
are validated, apart from learning a little bit about lazy evaluation and
thunks.
</p>

<p>
The day ended with burritos and game night Mafia!
