I've been caught "shooting" with a camera and looked upon as
'terrorist' material. Not once or twice, but 4 times, at 3
different places, by different people. Friends with "pro" cameras
(or pro-looking ones) have been stopped on quite a few occasions
being mistaken for reporters. I'm not talking of those
instances. I am counting the times when I've been in "real"
trouble and was treated as a potential terrorist. Four Times.
</p>

<p>
The last time was special, since I was robbed of cash by a Public
servant in the 'Khakhi', who was apparently doing his duties! I
leave the cribbing about corrupt men and lost cash for later. It
obviously didn't feel nice, being treated in that fashion.
</p>

<p>
And that, just for having a camera and trying to learn the art of
"shooting" pictures. Thankfully, it was something that I could,
shut off (along with my mouth) and throw into my backpack.

What of people born to parents who believe in a particular
god. People suspected for what their parents named them. People
suspected for dressing the way their fathers and mothers and
brothers and sisters dress.

Don't tell me I didn't warn you, if you walk into our lab sometime
and mistake it for a game zone in your neighbourhood. You are
indeed in "the" lab. If you came looking for Prof. Prabhu you'll
have to return. You'll only find PR vowing to see the end of
baali, for having a nice time pawning him. You won't find me
around - I'm cloaked and busy creating havoc. Unless, of course,
you are the seer KD. Watch your step extremely carefully or you
won't know when and how fuchmed's GM hit you. And don't dare
venture anywhere near madrazr, jumping all around with a
shockwave, unless you are capable enjoying some real nasty
shocks. Well, the team is busy in one of it's two SB sessions per
day. SB (short for Stress Buster) sessions are intense 15 minute
rounds of bzflag - 3D first person tank battle game.
</p>

<p>
Hope you didn't start thinking, I'm just goofing off here, doing
nothing at all. If it's not already clear, SB sessions are exactly
what they are called - Stress Busters. Just to refresh ourselves
and get back to work, with greater force. What then, am I doing
for the rest of my time?
</p>

<p>
Mainly I've been developing course content that we have been
working on, called Software Tools, Techniques and Practices. I
have been working on a session for elementary LaTeX and basic
Linux tools. I've also been attending classes of Digital Control
and trying to Python-ize the Matlab/Scilab code that the course
uses.
</p>

<p>
But, that's not all. I've helped a guy restore a Joomla site on
Day-1. I screwed up a brand new installation of a server with some
real skill; then expect to be screwed but get some encouragement
with the words, "It was a good learning experience for us." Seen a
Debian server upgrade from Etch to Lenny in under 10
minutes. Installed an instance of twiki and struggled to configure
it. Helped a Humanities Scholar with LaTeX. Attended a workshop on
Instruction Design. Restored Qmail on an old Fedora 3
server. Goofed around in gimp, for a CD cover and a T-shirt
design. Chipped in with bits, for mutating Ubuntu into
"LivePython". Did a bit of css and javascript tweaking… The list
goes on!
</p>

<p>
Now, don't you think we deserve the SB's? ;)

Lost in thought, in the maddening crowd waiting for the next train
on a Sunday evening, I was staring blankly, looking at nothing in
particular. I had come to see-off UC, Sunil and 9.
</p>

<p>
A man carrying a stretcher on his head, suddenly comes into my
focus and I have an impulse to look down. But, I manage to look at
people who are closer to the guy, and see looks of pity, shock and
disgust. Most of them looked down, sooner than later. It was not
long before the man, was right next to me and I could see an
injured man lying on the stretcher with a stream of blood oozing
out of his head. All I could manage was another expression of
pity, shock and disgust. I didn't want to act as if I had seen
nothing. I didn't want to stay as if I could do nothing about
it. I didn't want to look down. But, that's all I ended up
doing. The man carrying the stretcher was not exactly struggling,
but I'm sure he would've more than liked some help. Not one
amongst us moved.
</p>

<p>
Around half a minute later, I see a constable walking calmly
(maybe with a shade of concern in his stride) in that
direction. The next train was there in less than a minute and 9
got into it. I was feeling absolute disgust at my reaction. In the
hope of making some amends, I walked in the direction that the
stretcher guy took. Soon I found them. I didn't have to
search. There was an audience of onlookers, watching the stretcher
carrying guy inspect the other guy. He was waiting near the
entrance of the station and I'm guessing he had called for some
medical help and was waiting for it to arrive. The policeman and a
couple of others were standing next to him, while he was
inspecting the injuries. Everybody else was watching — from the
stairs, from the over bridge, the platform, the
tracks. Everywhere. Being a part of that crowd was the last thing
I wanted to do. I walked away.
</p>

<p>
PS: I (infact, we - uc, sunil, 9 and me) have had my own tryst
with the Mumbai local. Keep your head on your shoulders, while you
are anywhere near them. They are not the trains in your local
fair.

    <p>
Well, this could be called a post after ages, considering that
most of previous posts have just been 'news reports'. I have been
wanting to make a post since long, but I probably lost it. I
really am unable to write anything that I find worth posting [It
does raise questions about the existence of this blog. I'm writing
this, to answer that question to myself.]
</p>

<p>
This post is provoked by an act of sharing, an act of kindness, an
act of goodness, that surprised me. This post isn't about the act
itself, but it's about me being surprised. Why on earth should I
(or anybody) be surprised, when someone is just being human?
Aren't human beings meant to be and feel human?
</p>

<p>
I wonder why people say, "this is a bad, bad world." I find a lot
of goodness and humanness around me. Unless I strain my memory
really hard, I can only recall people who try to be as good and
nice as they can be; People trying to be as human as
possible. Either there's something utterly wrong with my judgment
of people or there's something wrong with the general feeling that
the world is a bad, bad place.
</p>

<p>
There's one other possibility that just strikes me - I am so nice
to people that, everyone else tries to be nice with me. I don't
think I am such a big deviation from the average. I'm just another
goat, in the great herd.
</p>

<p>
And another one, I'm in a really special place, presently. I have
been only to the special places. I have visited only the places
that are at an extreme, far away from the 'average' place in the
world. But, given I'm just another goat in the great herd, this is
very unlikely. I am probably grazing at a random spot on the great
grasslands.
</p>

<p>
Since these are ruled out, it boils down to either a wrong
judgment or a wrong general feeling.
</p>

<p>
Coming to my judgment, I wouldn't call myself an Oracle or the
wise one, but I'm no dumb ass either. Well, taking the statistical
route, the number of times I've had any real "nasty" surprises in
dealing with people has been much lesser than the number of times
things turned out nearly as expected. My judgment could,
therefore, possibly given some credibility.
</p>

<p>
So, that leaves me with just one possibility. The idea that the
world is a bad, bad place is not entirely true, if not completely
absurd and outright wrong. The world is really a nice place, with
"human" beings inhabiting it. The nasty surprises that you get,
really are the surprises and not the general rule.

<blockquote>
<p>
Our design of this introductory computer-science subject
reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the
idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a
computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel
formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus,
programs must be written for people to read, and only
incidentally for machines to execute. Second, we believe that
the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this
level is not the syntax of particular programming-language
constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular
functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of
algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the
techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of
large software systems.

I would like to see a few courses developed on similar lines here.

<li>Gmail themes are good. I only tried the "Terminal" theme,
though. I loved it!

moved to Intrepid from Hardy. (and that too with the campus
net!) This was before the repositories had been set-up. Now, it
should be a much simpler job to achieve the same

And eating food and taking naps<br>
And hoping that someday perhaps<br>
Your life will hold some cheer<br><br>
Happy birthday!<br>
What have you done that matters?<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
You're starting to get fatter<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
It's downhill from now on<br>
Try not to remind yourself<br>
Your best years are all gone<br><br>
If cryogenics were all free<br>
Then you could live like Walt Disney<br>
And live for all eternity<br>
Inside a block of ice<br><br>
But instead your time is set<br>
This is the only life you get<br>
And though it hasn't ended yet<br>
Sometimes you wish it might<br><br>
Happy birthday!<br>
You wish you had more money<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
Your life's so sad it's funny<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
How much more can you take?<br>
But your friends are hungry<br>
So just cut the stupid cake<br><br>
Happy birthday!<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
Happy birthday, dear…<br></p>

Three Cheers to 'Free Software'!
</p>

<p>
A toast for GNU on its 25th Birthday!<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/software-freedom-day.html#fn.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>
If you intend to ask, what I did on this day, I have nothing to show. I haven't done anything that's tangible but yes, I have re-dedicated myself to the idea of Free Software.
This post intends to shed some light on a few things (if not for the benefit of others, just as a reminder for myself)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Free Software is a matter of liberty, not price. I've often been
in a position that required me to correct people. 'Free
Software' is software that's free as in free speech and not free
beer. For the lack of a better word in english, the word 'free'
which also means gratis has been used. Using the term 'Libre'
sometimes helps and if you are in this part of the world, "mukt"
is the best word to use.
</li>
<li>Free Software<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="/posts/software-freedom-day.html#fn.2">2</a></sup> comes along with four fundamental freedoms. To put
it simply, the freedom to use, study, share and modify any
software.
</li>
<li>Free Software may have the advantage of being 'technically
sounder', but the philosophy is what matters the most to me.
</li>
<li>I will do whatever is possible within my capacity to spread the
philosophy and the associated freedom
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Be Free, My Friend!
</p>

<p>
Here is an extract from one of Stallman's <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/software-freedom-day.html#fn.3">3</a></sup> essays:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We must talk about Freedom
</p>

<p>
Estimates today are that there are ten million users of
GNU/Linux systems such as Debian GNU/Linux and Red Hat
Linux. Free software has developed such practical advantages
that users are flocking to it for purely practical reasons.
</p>

<p>
The good consequences of this are evident: more interest in
developing free software, more customers for free software
businesses, and more ability to encourage companies to develop
commercial free software instead of proprietary software
products.
</p>

<p>
But interest in the software is growing faster than awareness
of the philosophy it is based on, and this leads to
trouble. Our ability to meet the challenges and threats
described above depends on the will to stand firm for
freedom. To make sure our community has this will, we need to
spread the idea to the new users as they come into the
community.
</p>

<p>
But we are failing to do so: the efforts to attract new users
into our community are far outstripping the efforts to teach
them the civics of our community. We need to do both, and we
need to keep the two efforts in balance.
</p>

    <p>
This post is just to keep up a promise that I made to a friend of
mine (well, actually myself).  Presently, its the placement heat
in our campus and people are busy writing tests, waiting, giving
interviews and partying. This post doesn't have much to with all
that though.  In one of the interviews, I was called back and
asked about my Cleft Lip and Palate<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/the-third-round.html#fn.1">1</a></sup>. The interview panel had
concerns if I faced any serious medical problems due to this. I
explained to them everything that I knew about it and they were
convinced.
</p>

<p>
Later, I realized, I never explicitly did any reading on this
issue or asked my parents/others about this. I somehow knew about
it always. I probably learnt at all those visits to the dentist or
may be sub-consciously, when I was a baby. It isn't, though,
surprising to me that those guys had some reservations about
it. It's not everyday that you see a guy with a Cleft, though
statistics say there's prevalence of 1 in 500 births
world-wide. As a matter of fact, I myself haven't seen another guy
all my life (except for the pictures at my dentists') (also, they
weren't too wrong in suspecting other problems, though they had
absolutely no clue about this medical condition)
</p>

<p>
If you are wondering what the point of this post is, it's
nothing. It's just a pointer to those interested in reading
further on Cleft Lip and Palate.
