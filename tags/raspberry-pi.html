<li>NYC's library also had an interesting exhibhition on the history of

unusable.

<li>The TTS part is more or less working right now, the next step would be to
deploy it on the RaspberryPi and start using it as a radio, to see what my
needs are like. Hooking it up to <a href="https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client">Jasper client</a> seems like a good idea,
right now… though I'm not sure if it would work very well, with the pi's

<li>Post lunch, I started pairing with Stephanie on the exercises in the <a href="http://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm">Hacking</a>
book, and that turned out to be super fun!
</li>
<li>We got through the chapter on exploitation, which focussed on stack
overflows, heap overflows, overflows in function pointers, and string
formatting exploits.  It acted as more than a gentle refresher for C, and was
super fun!
</li>
<li>Running the examples on a 64bit system, added an additional amount of
thinking required, and was good, IMO.

think I'm done with it until the end of HackerSchool.
</li>
<li>I also tried to look for "easy" python issues that would involve me writing
some C code, but didn't really find anything other than documentation… I
guess, I should pick a module and look for bugs in it, instead.
</li>
<li>Also, while chatting with a friend, I had to explain that I don't mention the
last names of people or link to them, for privacy reasons.  Hacker School is
particularly careful about not divulging information about who are at Hacker
School each batch, and I want to keep that tradition.

<li>It turned out that the SPI driver exposed a faster way to write bits, writing
to all the LEDs at once, instead of one at a time, and this was sufficient to
get things working!
</li>

<li>Kyle and I started to have enough, of the glowing LEDs and decided to wrap up
the project, but, Nick had different ideas for us! We had talked about having
the music stream via airplay, but Nick got his DJing tools, and it would be
too bad to not use it for the party, but doing that meant Airplay's delay
wouldn't help the DJ. So, we connected a line-in, and thought we'd be done if
we just read the input and used that data. But, it turns out that's not so
simple because sending data over the wire, added noise to it, and in a whole
range of frequencies! I tried removing all the fourier coefficients which
were lower than a threshold, but I felt like it didn't work very well, until
Nick reduced the gain of this output on the amp to the very minimum. Finally,
Kyle and I decided that this was good enough for the party!
</li>

<li>I also hacked up a quick script to read a font file, and use the grey values
to get ascii characters to show up on the LED strip.

<li>Kyle and I went and grabbed dinner in a restaurant in west village. It was
good to sit down and talk about various things, and eat. The glowing LEDs
were totally out of my mind for that period, and the break was good!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mel's talk in the morning was brilliant!  I wonder why it's not a part of
recommended reading for Hacker Schoolers, or referred to, in the manual.
</li>
<li>Logically, it makes sense that Mel came now, so that she didn't have to come
twice to talk to the firsts and seconds, but it would have been great to have
had this talk in the first week of Hacker School!
</li>
<li>Mel gave us a lot of new information and insights into education and learning
styles. I also like the fact that she gave us all a good vocabulary to think
about and discuss stuff related to learning. I will try to think, and apply
as much of this as I can, for the rest of my time here.
</li>
<li>She talked about <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2014/02/10/test-driven-learning-setting-learning-goals-for-yourself-software-engineering-edition/">test driven learning</a> which seemed very interesting. Instead
of just saying, "wow that would be an interesting thing to do", stop for a
moment, think about what you are trying to learn, and how you will assess if
you have learnt what you wanted to, and then dive into the project.
</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html">learning styles</a> workshop was pretty good too, though I feel like I don't
know myself well enough, and I unable to properly "bucket" myself.  Later, I
took a <a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html">quiz</a>, and ended up fairly close to the middle, in all the dimensions.
</li>
<li>Mel introduced us to the idea of <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/201816780/A-Cognitive-Apprenticeship-Primer">cognitive apprenticeship</a>, and encouraged us
to try out the different modes when pairing. I really liked the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development">Zone
of proximal development</a> and I will try to take the advice of spending most of
the rest of my time here in this zone.
</li>
<li>Do I (really) care?  Motivation and mindset, …
</li>
<li>Be courageous!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I was trying to wrap libshairport and use it on the RPi to be able to listen
to songs being streamed on Airplay, and use that data to drive the LEDs.
</li>
<li>Shairport, a tool written in C seemed to work.  My attempts to wrap
<code>libshairport</code>, which is a fork of <code>shairport</code> converting it into a library,
failed miserably.
</li>
<li>The trouble was essentially getting Airplay to discover my service.  I tried
a bunch of things with <code>pybonjour</code> and <code>avahi</code>, but wasn't able to get it
right.
</li>
<li>Finally, I tried just announcing the service with <code>shairport</code>, and actually
running a python script that wraps <code>libshairport</code> to listen to the data.
But, this didn't work and iTunes complained that this Airplay device is not
compatible. Before going much further with this, I found <code>shairplay</code> which is
a tool similar to <code>shairport</code>, but came with a library, and also Python
bindings!  I happily used this to get stuff working!
</li>
<li>I'm interested to see today, what exactly I was missing yesterday!

<li>It was exciting to have so many new Hacker Schoolers in the space.  But, the
excitement was kinda distracting too.
</li>

<li>I spent most of the day looking at shairport, and libshairport and trying to
wrap it, so I can use it to get data for the spectrum analyzer via the
Air-play protocol.  I was able to call it using <code>ctypes</code>, but it doesn't seem
discoverable.
</li>

<li>I also briefly looked at Julia and <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org">dwm</a>, to try and port dwm to Julia.  It
doesn't seem like too much work, but is going to take me a while given how
comfortable I'm with both Julia and C.
</li>

<li>Yaron Minsky's talk on distributed systems was a great introduction to
Distributed systems.
</li>

<li>After the talk, I spent a little time updating my notes from an old org-mode
workshop to present it at the emacs user group meet up today.

<li>During the weekend, I had this idea of building a personalized "radio" for
myself using a Raspberry pi.  The idea is to have a service where all my
bookmarks, and feeds are accumulated to, instead of eating up valuable
browser tab real estate.  And then, I could use a Raspberry pi to randomly
play content off of it, based on a theme.
</li>

<li>I worked on getting things together for it, during the weekend.  The project
is more like a "thing that needs to be done", rather than something that puts
me out of my comfort zone, atleast as far as I can see. So, I'm just going to
work on it as a background thing, between other projects, etc.
</li>

<li>Festival seemed OK initially, while I was trying things out, but when I
actually used it to read me a blog post, it was really terrible!  I tried
demos of a few commercial tools, and they seem much better than what festival
had to offer.  I wonder what it would take to get Festival, up there.  I
tried using Google's translate service's tts (unofficial API) and it seemed
so good!  But, it limits each request to 100 bytes, and the audio will have
to be downloaded via the Network.
</li>

<li>Madhu pointed me to MaryTTS, which seemed to be an active project and it
seemed to be much better than Festival, though not as good as Google's tts.
I'm going to try getting it to run on a Pi, next.

around with the Pi, for the past week-ish, and it has been fun!  Kyle and I
will probably work more on tweaking it, to get it to work the way we want
it, for the party!
</li>

<li>I also did a little bit of Julia with Sean, and it was fun.  I may try
playing around with it, a little bit, but not sure what to work on.  May be
continue working through the think-complexity book using Julia?
</li>

<li>Or jump into something I totally don't know about, inspired by listening to
Julia Evans' podcast for Ruby Rogues.  I just got this idea of trying to
write a window manager to understand how X works, and what wayland is…  I
could try porting dwm or i3wm to Julia.

<li>Kyle and I did a demo of our spectrum analyzer/visualizer during the
presenations.  It was fun to work on, though we mostly just followed a
tutorial on the web, and made use of a bunch of libraries.
</li>
<li>I spent the night in HackerSchool.
</li>
<li>I was cleaning up the code in the tutorial we were trying to follow.
</li>
<li>Also, cleaned up the install.sh used by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/togiles/lightshowpi/src">lightshowpi</a> project to not do all the
ugly sudo setups, and use a Python virtualenv and install into that.
</li>
<li>Refactored the ugly looking music part of the tutorial into a smaller script
with only the functionality that we were going to use.
</li>
<li>We hit an interesting bug that would light up all the LEDs on the strip, once
in a while.  I didn't notice it during the night, because I had a "decay"
factor (the max factor by which the height of the columns should get reduced
between successive updates) was 0.9, but when the decay factor was reduced to
a lower value, it would happen quite often.  Also, we didn't see this
happening before.  So, we thought the bug was in the code I had written, when
I should have been sleeping. After reading and debugging my code for a bit,
with Kyle and Sean, I thought it was something hardware related that we were
doing wrong.  But, it turns out that a library we were using lit-up the whole
strip, when start and end values were both zero, instead of not lighting up
anything!
</li>
<li>Also, we hit another off-by one error, just before the demo. I didn't do the
math for splitting the strip into columns too carefully, and we hadn't
noticed the off-by one error until we taped up the strip into different
columns on a pillar for demo.
</li>
<li>There were some cool presentations by others.  I'll update the list on
Monday, since I currently don't remember them all!  Looking at the list of
names on the registration sheet would help!
