I was travelling in a bus today, when I overheard two people
sitting behind me. One of the guy was telling the other about his
brother's job and the hardships he faces. The guy they were
talking about, practically risks his life, to be able to eat a
square meal. He works on Billboards, used to paint them and now
that there aren't enough people who get them painted, pastes the
vinly posters on to the boards.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All day a guy struggles hard, to transform an ugly looking, old
hoarding into a huge attractive advertisement and he is paid so
well, that he has to slog it out to make ends meet for his family
of four. They who get the paintings made or the posters put up,
are striking it rich with loads of money and fame. Those who drive
by, are having a good time watching that beautiful looking woman
there or fantasizing themselves in that wonderful car up
there. Then why is this person here, who slogs it out, making so
many people happy, struggling to see a smile on his daughter?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When people around can get paid handsomely for having a jolly time
in the air-conditioned room, puking out a few lines of code each
day, can't this guy, sweating it out in this may heat, get a
better deal? Isn't there something fundamentally wrong
somewhere?
