Don't tell me I didn't warn you, if you walk into our lab sometime
and mistake it for a game zone in your neighbourhood. You are
indeed in "the" lab. If you came looking for Prof. Prabhu you'll
have to return. You'll only find PR vowing to see the end of
baali, for having a nice time pawning him. You won't find me
around - I'm cloaked and busy creating havoc. Unless, of course,
you are the seer KD. Watch your step extremely carefully or you
won't know when and how fuchmed's GM hit you. And don't dare
venture anywhere near madrazr, jumping all around with a
shockwave, unless you are capable enjoying some real nasty
shocks. Well, the team is busy in one of it's two SB sessions per
day. SB (short for Stress Buster) sessions are intense 15 minute
rounds of bzflag - 3D first person tank battle game.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hope you didn't start thinking, I'm just goofing off here, doing
nothing at all. If it's not already clear, SB sessions are exactly
what they are called - Stress Busters. Just to refresh ourselves
and get back to work, with greater force. What then, am I doing
for the rest of my time?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mainly I've been developing course content that we have been
working on, called Software Tools, Techniques and Practices. I
have been working on a session for elementary LaTeX and basic
Linux tools. I've also been attending classes of Digital Control
and trying to Python-ize the Matlab/Scilab code that the course
uses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, that's not all. I've helped a guy restore a Joomla site on
Day-1. I screwed up a brand new installation of a server with some
real skill; then expect to be screwed but get some encouragement
with the words, "It was a good learning experience for us." Seen a
Debian server upgrade from Etch to Lenny in under 10
minutes. Installed an instance of twiki and struggled to configure
it. Helped a Humanities Scholar with LaTeX. Attended a workshop on
Instruction Design. Restored Qmail on an old Fedora 3
server. Goofed around in gimp, for a CD cover and a T-shirt
design. Chipped in with bits, for mutating Ubuntu into
"LivePython". Did a bit of css and javascript tweakingâ€¦ The list
goes on!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, don't you think we deserve the SB's? ;)
