&lt;li&gt;We worked on writing our own (toy) version control system on Friday, as a
part of job prep.  I paired with Sophia, and we got upto the point where we
had diffs working, when we decided to refactor the code with some tests and
stuff.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The party was brilliant with a lot of activity.  All the project
installations looked so cool, and it was so much fun!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent some time during the weekend watching the "Anatomy of Matplotlib"
lectures.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started some work with poking around Matplotlib's template backend, and
trying to start writing and ascii backend.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, I was trying to help UC setup &lt;a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/groovebasin"&gt;GrooveBasin&lt;/a&gt; on his raspberry pi, and
helped him configure &lt;a href="https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client"&gt;jasper&lt;/a&gt; on it.
&lt;/li&gt;
