After a trek, I had an interesting conversation with Ritesh, about
taking pictures during a trip. He said, he started to realize that
when he's lost in the cycle of click, see, analyze, click,
… when he's got a cam in his hand. He didn't have a cam on this
trek and thoroughly enjoyed it!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I connect to this phenomenon, as well. I think, like Ritesh says,
having separate trips for Photography makes sense. On other trips,
we could be clicking, but just for the sake of memory. Trying to
get amazing photographs shouldn't be a goal.
I should refrain from -
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looking at the output and adjusting repeatedly until it's
perfect.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clicking too many pictures in a given length of time.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For both of this, a film camera seems to be the solution!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What say, Ritesh?

This post is my attempt to start a travelogue. I hope to capture
the "All India Tour" phase of my life (as people have started to
call it).  I'll try to keep these posts from becoming travel
guides. There are loads of them and I surely don't need to
increment count.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This post is after a trip to Kanpur, Agra and Sikri.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trains are never on Time. The delay increases exponentially with
your distance from the sourthern most tip of the country. Also,
the confidence of the aam admi in this delay is proportional to
the distance. Any delay less than an hour wasn't considered to
be a delay. Thanks to the fog, low visibility.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to travel around India, all you need is an
SLR. Additionally, if you are not of Indian origin, you'll need
the "India" guide. I got bored of seeing people poring over the
pages of that "blue" India book or madly clicking away on their
SLRs.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether or not you get food or water on a train, you are assured
of enough "chilled" air from the slit under your window. Come
what may, you shall not be deprived of this service.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trust of a person in you is inversely proportional to the
difference between your ages. It is inversely proportional to
the 2.718th power of the difference if you are aged between 20
and 25. I only vaguely remember what the TTE told me in my
sleep, while paying the fine for not carrying a print out of our
e-ticket; but, it really was something sick and senseless.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chill at a place, on the day you reach, is inversely
proportional to how much people have scared/warned you. On the
rest of the days, it is proportional to the square of the warm
clothing you have on you. I thoroughly enjoyed the chill of
Kanpur. Wonderful! The infrastructure, too good! Never expected
a 50 year old campus to be so Awesome. [They have an air-strip
too!]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thrill of having an ice-cream is proportional to the square
of difference between the ambient temperature and the standard
room temperature.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't ever think of celebrating your escape, without the Aalu
encounter. Welcome to the land of Alu addicted men. You shall,
surely, have your share. If not anything else, you shall be
serverd a Capsicum or Brinjal stuffed with Aalu. Also, the
quality and availability of leather seems to be proportional to
the addiction to Aalu.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"hawker time" - the time you spend being followed by hawkers
trying to convince you to buy whatever they
have. "firang-ness" - difficult to predict; a parameter that
depends on the amount of branded stuff on you, stylishness of
your winter wear and other unknown variableness. Your hawker
time is proportional to (firang-ness) \* abs(time of day in 24
hr clock - 1400) [when, 900 &amp;lt; time &amp;lt; 1800] I understand, that,
they need to make ends meet; each day of their lives. I got
followed a lot. I can't help observing. Sometimes, enjoyed being
followed too.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Taj. Simply Awe-Inspiring. As Madhu put it, "the longer you
keep watching it, the more it's beauty overwhelms you". But, I
still think, the first time is the best time to see it. It's
simply mind blowing when you get the first glimpse, after entering
from the West gate.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's time to stop writing when all you can see is proportionality
between totally unrelated things.  Here are a few pics
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>book</category><category>camera</category><category>india</category><category>nomadic</category><category>photo</category><category>travel</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/pehli-nazar.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2010 20:37:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Shoot!</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/shoot.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I've been caught "shooting" with a camera and looked upon as
'terrorist' material. Not once or twice, but 4 times, at 3
different places, by different people. Friends with "pro" cameras
(or pro-looking ones) have been stopped on quite a few occasions
being mistaken for reporters. I'm not talking of those
instances. I am counting the times when I've been in "real"
trouble and was treated as a potential terrorist. Four Times.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The last time was special, since I was robbed of cash by a Public
servant in the 'Khakhi', who was apparently doing his duties! I
leave the cribbing about corrupt men and lost cash for later. It
obviously didn't feel nice, being treated in that fashion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And that, just for having a camera and trying to learn the art of
"shooting" pictures. Thankfully, it was something that I could,
shut off (along with my mouth) and throw into my backpack.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What of people born to parents who believe in a particular
god. People suspected for what their parents named them. People
suspected for dressing the way their fathers and mothers and
brothers and sisters dress.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Wonder when the world 'll grow up…
