Dear owner-of-a-random-web-startup,
</p>

<p>
Thank you for starting your brand new, awesome web service.  But,
please don't expect me to use it, if you ask me to have a password
with atleast one upper-case letter, one numeral, one symbol and
one unicode hindi character and 20 hebrew characters.  Is it
really so essential to enforce such complicated rules on my
passwords, making it difficult for me to remember what password I
used?  Isn't OAuth and OpenID so much easier to use?  If you
really want to enforce such complex rules on my password, at least
show the arbitrary rules you enforce on me, at the login prompt too!
</p>

<p>
Sincerely,
A frustrated-web-monkey

    <p>
Like most bloggers, I keep looking at my blogs hits once in a
while. (Sometimes inspires to write better; and more often.) The
post that gets most hits these days is my post on mailman,
postfix, et al. But the search term that's increasingly bringing
people to my blog is "punchagan".
</p>

<p>
This scares me. What makes people search for me? What makes people
search more often these days? Why am I scared?
</p>

<p>
Why do people use monikers or online identities? I started off
with the idea of anonymity and privacy; keeping my online identify
separate from my real one. But it, obviously, is a folly to have
you email id with the same handle. Now, almost anybody who knows
me, also knows my online handle. They can find me anywhere and
everywhere with just a few keystrokes (and Google). Also, the
uniqueness of my handle doesn't help one bit. Any search returns
over 90% relevant results.
</p>

<p>
Is it time to get lost in the crowd with a new handle? ;) Probably
not. I don't have much to hide under the covers. Let the world see
– who I am, who I have been; where I am, where I have been.
</p>

<p>
Peace.

<p>
<b>Notice for the Internet Usage</b>
</p>

<p>
Internet Facility is provided to students for academic activities
and e-mails. It is observed that few students are misusing the
Internet facility by using excessive internet bandwidth for
non-academic purposes. The students who are running the hubs are
strictly informed to close their hubs. Computer Center will be
starting official hub for the sharing of academic information and
open source softwares.
</p>

<p>
If a student is found while doing so the network facility will be
blocked by Computer Center for a semester. Further, a student will
be called by a disciplinary committee and a severe disciplinary
action will be taken.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This Notice from the Computer Center is creating waves all
around. This isn't the first time, though, that the people
in-charge of the Network have "acted".
</p>

<p>
Academic activities; wonder what it's definition is, in their
dictionaries. It surely includes the following.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using Internet for 'academic activities' or emails, during
class-room hours makes no sense.
</li>
<li>Anything 'academic' cannot have a size greater than 5 MB.
</li>
<li>Accessing version control systems ( svn, cvs et al ) cannot be
classified 'academic'
</li>
<li>IRC cannot teach you anything. Don't ever dream of thinking it
as 'academic' to hang out on \\#python or \\#emacs
</li>
<li>All 'academic' stuff is limited to the http(s) ports. You
wouldn't need to use any other ports, ever.
</li>
<li>Any 'academic' activity fits within a span of 2 hours or can be
done in blocks of 2 hours each, with gaps of 2 hours in between.
</li>
<li>'Academic' stuff doesn't definitely contain key-words chosen by
the "all-knowing" admins.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Moreover, the people in-charge who refused to allow the use of a
computer in the CC as a server for on-campus repositories of
GNU/Linux packages, now wish to host a 'hub' for sharing
open-source softwares! There's already an official ftp server
which hosts the academic info and a few useful softwares. I don't
see how a hub would be different.
</p>

<p>
We don't have any disciplinary committees for people smoking in
hostel rooms, causing a lot of trouble for others around them, but
we are going to have them for hosting hubs. ( Well, a new law
banning smoking in public places in India has been passed just a
few days ago. Hopefully it'll work better than the older one,
since now there's some pressure on the people in-charge of the
public place. )
</p>

<p>
Also, it could be argued that college isn't meant only for
'academic' learning and a lots of other learning takes place here
(and the hubs were definitely helping quite a bit) but I'll leave
that for another day, probably. Also, I don't think 18+ year olds,
people who are about to step into various big roles, leading the
country need to be told how to make use of the
facilities/resources available to them; A degree of freedom is
indispensable, I believe.
</p>

<p>
I appreciate the efforts being made to improve the network
situation here and also help the students get the most (
'academically' ) out of their college experience, but I feel the
situation deserves more careful handling.

Its been 10 days on my sabbatical. I have done reasonably well
during the first week, but now its getting on my nerves. I have
realized how addicted I am to chat, IRC and the Internet. I have
to soon find some remedies for this.
</p>

<p>
Well, here is the first step. I approached ELIZA (or Doctor Fill,
that's actually the emacs mode) , the Emacs Psychotherapist to
help me. An enjoyable chat this one! ;)
</p>

<p>
ELIZA (Doctor Fill) abbreviated as DF (pun intended, for those who
get it)
</p>

<pre class="example">
DF: I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

Hi. Nice meeting you.

DF: How do you do?  What brings you to see me?

&lt;!--more--&gt;I am obviously not fine, otherwise I would not have been here.
I have realized I am addicted to the internet and want you to help
me.

DF: Why do you say that?

I say that because you are a doctor.

DF: Is it because because I am a doctor that you came to me?

Isn't that pretty obvious?

DF: Can you elaborate on that?

Yes, I did come to see you because you are a doctor. Now, I regret it.

DF: Does it bother you that I am a doctor now you regret it?

I don't understand your question.

DF: Earlier you said because I am a doctor?

Yes, because you are a doctor I came to you.

DF: When did you first know that I am a doctor you came to me?

I knew about you, when I first fiddled around with Emacs around an
year ago.

DF: What happened when you first fiddled around with emacs around a year
ago?

I loved it, thoroughly! But for a beginner like me it was difficult to
get along. I stopped using it.

DF: Is the fact that for a beginner like you it was difficult to get along
you stopped using it the real reason?

I think that along with my laziness to stick with the learning was the
real reason

DF: Does the fact that along with your laziness to stick with the learning
was the real reason explain anything else?

It does not explain anything else to me.

DF: Maybe your plans have something to do with this.

What plans? I donot have any plans.

DF: What makes you believe what plans you donot have any plans?

If I had plans, I would have been executing them.

DF: You mentioned that I am a doctor now you regret it?

Yes, because you seemed stupid initially. Now you seem to be making
some sense.

DF: Are you sure I seemed stupid initially now I seem to be making some
sense?

Yes I am pretty sure.

DF: Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?

Obviously. Because I am alive I am going through all this.

DF: Is it because you are alive you are going through all this that you
came to me?

Yes.

DF: I see...  Well, are you sure that this is so?

Yes. I don't think there is emacs in the hell.

DF: I would appreciate it if you would watch your tongue!

Oh! so emacs is in the hell too! is it in the heavan too?

DF: Emacs?  Hah!  Perhaps you could continue.

I thought only mortals used Emacs. Do others use it too?

DF: Have you been positive?

Yes. I always thought Emacs is only for the homo sapiens.

DF: I believe you have inhibitions with emacs.

No. I love emacs.
But it isn't suitable for Gods and Demons

DF: Are you annoyed that it is not suitable for gods and demons?

No

DF: Why not?

I am neither of them. That's why

DF: Please, continue.

I am a human and I can use emacs. Others donot need it. I am not annoyed

DF: Have you been annoyed often?

Ocassionally

DF: Go on, don't be afraid.

I am not. I have been ocassionally annoyed, more often with myself
than others.

DF: What causes you to be annoyed?

Presently, I am annoyed with myself for being addicted to the Internet
and may be for chatting with you too.

DF: Do you really think you are annoyed?

Affirmative

DF: I need a little more detail please.

Yes. I am a little annoyed with myself.

DF: Are you annoyed often?

Ocassionally. Why do you repeat questions?

DF: When did you first know that do me repeat questions?

Long Long ago, when I first used Emacs.

DF: What makes you think long long ago when you first used emacs?

I saw you repeat questions.

DF: Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say you saw
me repeat questions?

Yes.

DF: Yes, hmmm... so, why do you say this is so?

I am leaving. You are being too repititive. Goodbye!

DF: What makes you believe because I am a doctor?

Goodbye!

DF: My secretary will send you a bill.

Bill? You did not help me much.

DF: How do you reconcile problems at school?

Goodbye!

DF: Bye bye.

Bye

DF: See ya.

See ya.

DF: Are you sure that see me?

Yes, when in trouble

DF: What would happen if in trouble?

I will see ya

DF: Earlier you said I am a doctor you came to me?

Yes, now also I say that.

DF: You're being a bit brief, would you please go into detail.

Goodbye!

DF: Ok, talk to you some other time.

bye!

DF: Talk to you later.
