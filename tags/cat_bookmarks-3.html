<p>
I’ve encountered a few misconceptions about what Hacker School is
and who it’s for. I’m not an official source of information; for
that, I recommend the User’s Manual and this blog post. Having said
that, here are a few things I’ve heard people say that attest to
misconceptions about Hacker School, and my responses to them.

<p>
From Angelo’s blog: “I remember the exact moment…Jen’s voice and the
numb feeling that enveloped me. That feeling has never left. I’ll
also never forget how we looked into each other’s eyes and held each
other’s hands. ‘We are together, we’ll be ok.’”

Throughout her battle, Angelo decided to photograph it. He wanted to
humanize  the face of cancer on the face of his wife. The photos
speak for themselves.

<p>
We're one month into the second year of Catalyst, an after-school
tech/computer class that I run for kids aged 9-13, and this year
I've decided to try something different. [Last year, I had the kids
learn in a browser-based / console-like IDE that I created - kind of
like CodeAcademy, but ultimately it was just too much work to
maintain and too limiting]. My new plan is to teach the kids how to
build their own interactive websites from scratch using HTML, CSS
and Javascript, and to do it on their own Linux VPS (CentOS 6) using
Vim. I know it probably sounds crazy, but if the preliminary
reception and results are any indication, I think it's going to be a
success.

Here is a fun bucket list of the places you simply have to visit

ride through Ladakh, trekking through the valley of flowers in
Himalayas to surfing in Orissa, here are some insane experiences.

ones. A life will be meaningful if it finds responses to the four
questions of purpose, value, efficacy, and self-worth. It is these
questions, not the answers, that endure and unify.

<a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/modern-art-vs-toddler-art/">QUIZ: Modern Art or Children’s Drawings? | Bored Panda</a>

<p>
:art:
</p>

<p>
Art, and what we do and do not consider to be art, has changed a lot
over the last century. It has become an increasingly difficult thing
to define for the average person, and sometimes even art historians
and experts can’t seem to keep up.
</p>

<p>
This was illustrated in a 2005 survey done by ABC News in which
modern masters’ works were mixed into a series with paintings done
by children and toddlers. Regular people and art critics alike were
asked to choose from the series – which of these works belong in a
museum and which ones don’t? Now, Buzzfeed has released a similar
survey as well, which we’ve expanded on a bit.
</p>

<p>
The results of that survey indicate that either we have a long way
to go before we can define what is and isn’t modern art, or that
there’s no need to define it so strictly in the first
place. Whatever the case may be, let’s see if you’re any better at
telling modern art from children’s drawings than the experts are!

The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.

The idea is simple: we’ve prepared a dataset with all the questions on Stack Overflow, including everything we knew about them right before they were posted, and whether they finally ended up closed or not.  You grab the data, build your brilliant classifier, run it against some leaderboard data and submit your results.  Rinse and repeat until the contest ends, when we’ll grab the most promising classifiers and run them against fresh data to choose winners.

think twice before you join a company as a first (or very early) employee, and if you do decide to join negotiate for as large a chunk of stock as you think your position/commitment/drop in pay justifies and be prepared to walk if that is not possible.
