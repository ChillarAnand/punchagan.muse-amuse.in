It's just a co-incidence that this post is coming on
Independence day.
</p>

<p>
Last night I was in an auto with a couple of friends, and the
auto couldn't get up a slope and stopped near the edge of the
slope which was leading onto a main road. We had to get down
from the auto, and after a lot of fight, the auto got on top.
As the driver was trying hard to get the auto moving, a guy
comes over and starts talking to him in Marathi. I'm not sure
if he was a traffic police. He was dressed in white, but
didn't really look like one.
</p>

<p>
After asking a few questions, but not getting any replies, the
guy asks him in Hindi, if he understands Marathi, and on
getting a negative reply, starts shouting on him!
</p>

<p>
The guy harasses the driver, asking him to handover his
license and threatens him of horrible consequences, if he
doesn't do so. We tried to intervene saying, we want to leave
early and stuff, but the auto refused to start. The driver
asked us to leave and said he'll take care of the matter.
</p>

<p>
And then, today I hear people talking of national integration
and stuff. I hear stuff about changing the country, getting
rid of corrupt politicians and all the high ideals crap. I
keep hearing all sorts of patriotic songs that I hear only
twice a year. Not once more than that.
</p>

<p>
Why is it that we talk of all this only on these two days of
National importance? Why are these songs played only twice a
year? Don't we get that feeling of patriotism on other days?
Isn't patriotism a "true" feeling?
</p>

<p>
I think, India will only take a leap in it's progress, when
that happens.

It's a one liner with grub2.
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mount/point/of/root/ /dev/sdX

<p>
where <code>sdX</code> is <code>sda,sdb,..</code> depending on which hard-drive it is
on.
</p>

<p>
This is the first instance when I found grub2 to be better
than grub.

I like the idea of pair blogging. Cate and Sacha, seem to be doing
it (intentionally or not). One person blogs on a topic he/she's
presently thinking about and the other person posts his/her views
on the same issue.  Well, comments are meant for that, but a blog
post seems to give you greater freedom.
</p>

<p>
PS: I called it pair-blogging. I don't know if it already has a
name or if pair-blogging means something else.

Drafting behind trucks (when cycling) could be a great energy
saver.  I came across this idea when reading up a blog post by a
cyclist.
</p>

<p>
The idea is similar to birds flying in a V-shape to get a greater
lift.  While drafting, the goal is to reduce the drag force.
</p>

<p>
Pacelines in cycling races are formed precisely for this reason.
This page has a short summary of what drafting is all about.
</p>

<p>
Should be trying this out, the next time around.

    <div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
Below is a mail sent by Eric Schulte to the org-mode mailing list
answering a query on how to write elisp for org-mode. I am
reproducing it here, since it is useful advice for me. The actual
thread is here.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
The way that I learned how to program in emacs lisp was mainly
using two commands `elisp-index-search' bound to `C-h e' on my
system, and most importantly `describe-function' bound to `C-h f'.
With `describe-function' you can look at the source code of
functions whose behavior you are familiar with, you can then copy
portions of the code to your <b>scratch</b> buffer where they can be
edited and evaluated with `eval-defun' bound to `C-M-x'.  Now with
Babel, instead of doing this in the scratch buffer you could do
this in emacs-lisp code blocks in an org file, enabling notes and
hierarchical organization – it can be nice to have your noodling
all collected in one file for later reference.
</p>

<p>
If you are going to do any serious work with lisp, I would
emphatically recommend using paredit-mode, and becoming friends
with the Sexp movement functions
</p>

<p>
C-M-f        runs the command paredit-forward
C-M-b        runs the command paredit-backward
C-M-u        runs the command backward-up-list
C-M-k        runs the command kill-sexp
C-y        runs the command yank
</p>

<p>
They allow you to manipulate lisp code on the level of logical
expressions, the utility of which can not be over stated.
</p>

<p>
As for working with Org-mode in particular, I'd recommend looking
at the documentation and source-code of Org-mode functions with
`describe-function', and then looking for how these functions are
actually used in the Org-mode code base with `rgrep'.
</p>

<p>
For a more structured learning experience, I've heard very good
things about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/</a>,
although I haven't used it myself.
</p>

<p>
Hope this helps.  Happy Hacking – Eric

In a world of (RSS &amp; Atom) feeds, deleting your posts is not the
way to do it.
</p>

<p>
First re-post using no content and give the post some time for it
to be caught by the feed aggregators. Then, delete your post.

 This

I hate it when I'm trying out things with org2blog - fixing bugs
or adding features - and my testing buffer gets posted. Why do I
keep passing the prefix argument with C-u? I should probably
work with a local instance of WordPress.

Heavy down-pour and landslides caused our train to be delayed by
over 12 hours. But the journey was on the whole enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
The novelty of the journey was that we had a bus ride from Adavali
to Ratnagiri, arranged by the Indian Railways, owing to bad tracks
near Ratnagiri.  It was very well planned and neatly executed.
Kudos Indian Railways!  The Konkan Rail route was at it's usual
best.

I just wanted to thank Sacha Chua for bearing with my newbie elisp
code and trying out org2blog.
</p>

<p>
Also, thanks for the two patches she sent.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Feature addition - Posting sub-trees instead of whole buffers.
I had this feature in mind, and had started working on it after
her request, but she was too quick for me! ;)

<li>Cleaning up of the code that uploads images.

I'm loving it!

No.  Not the Obama change.  I'm talking of change as in small
denominations of cash.  Everybody is reluctant to part with
it.  There's always a problem with getting it.  I'm often worried
before getting into a bus or an auto, or going to a shop whether
or not the guy would give me change for a 50, 100 or a 500.
People so reluctant to "part" with it. What are they saving it
for?
</p>

<p>
I think the situation would be much better if people readily gave
it, when required.  There would be a free flow and if not anything
more, I wouldn't have to worry about it when going somewhere.
But, I "feel" this would actually reduce the instances when both
the parties don't have enough change with them. What do you think?
