Cubr is a project I completed in three weeks at the end of my

mix up a Rubik’s cube. You show the cube to your computer’s

the cube begins to solve itself, and all you have to do is follow
along and you will have solved your cube!

Here's my advice for Lucy:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Stay wildly ambitious. The current world is bubbling with
opportunity for an ambitious person to find flowery, fulfilling
success. The specific direction may be unclear, but it'll work
itself out – just dive in somewhere.
</li>

<li>Stop thinking that you're special. The fact is, right now, you're
not special. You're another completely inexperienced young person
who doesn't have all that much to offer yet. You can become
special by working really hard for a long time.
</li>

<li>Ignore everyone else. Other people's grass seeming greener is no
new concept, but in today's image crafting world, other people's
grass looks like a glorious meadow. The truth is that everyone
else is just as indecisive, self-doubting, and frustrated as you
are, and if you just do your thing, you'll never have any reason
to envy others.

is your best choice.

<a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/11/practical-philosophy/">9 Mind Expanding Books Of Philosophy That Are Actually Readable (A Guide To Practical Philosophy) | Thought Catalog</a>

<p>
The irony is this is actually what ancient philosophy was intended
to ameliorate. “Vain is the word of a philosopher,” Epicurus once
said, “which does not heal the suffering of man.” Centuries later,
Thoreau expressed this same thought: “To be a philosopher is not
merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school . . . it
is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically,
but practically.”

<p>
A lot of people mistake flashy ultimate for “good” ultimate—they
think that chest-high layouts or 10-foot grabs in wolf packs are
hallmarks of the elite game. But I beg to differ. It’s true,
sometimes incredible feats of athleticism are the only way to save a
possession or get a block—and they aren’t easy to execute. Still,
it’s the most mundane things that often make the biggest impacts on
the field.

<p>
There is a time and a place for reflection and contemplation about
the greater universe. Now, I know I sound like a hypocrite because I
do write about these things a lot, but I’ll tell you now, as someone
who does over-think it, sometimes you just have to let it be what it
is and not become overwhelmed by the vastness, mysteriousness and
unknown possibility that lies around us. It can be more debilitating
than inspiring sometimes.

Before Hemant could nod his head, Sachin was already in the field as
a substitute for Pakistan. It was towards the end of the match and
Sachin was on the field for about 25 minutes."

<p>
Deep down, many of us wonder if we’re wasting our time on things of
little consequence. So we keep skittering along the surface at a
feverish pace, avoiding the mirror of introspection.
</p>

<p>
I’ve found recently that when the time is used well, slowness can
actually be one of the most profound sources of abundance.
</p>

<p>
And on the positive side, sometimes entrepreneurs work on their
businesses after hours out of love, rather than straining toward an
overly-optimistic deadline out of fear. I’ve been there, I’ve put in
the hours and I’ll do it again. But not unless I’m motivated by
love.
