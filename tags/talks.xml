CFP for PyCon 2016 is &lt;a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; and you should propose a talk!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There has been a lot of discussion on trying to improve the talk quality at the
events. As my bit of contribution to this, below is a re-hash of some good
advice from the internet on why you should give a talk, and how to submit a
good proposal.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/96692937#t=2m56s"&gt;needn't be an expert&lt;/a&gt; on a topic. If you have enough experience about
something to help make the next person's experience with it better, you are
good.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Its a great way to find people who are interested in the same things as you
are and to get to talk to them.  If you are an introvert, you should
&lt;a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/tech-talks-are-campfires-jesses-three-reasons-you-should-speak-at-pycon/#meet-specialists"&gt;definitely be speaking&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Proposing and giving a talk is about thinking about something hard enough to
refine your thoughts, and being able to explain it to others. Its a useful
skill to hone.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talks are &lt;a href="http://speaking.io/plan/talks-are-entertainment/"&gt;entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. Pick a topic that you are excited about and fascinated
by. Let it be a general topic that will have a significant number of people
interested in it.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What you want the attendees to be telling their friends about your talk,
after they go back.  Make it the &lt;a href="http://blog.briancurtin.com/posts/writing-a-pycon-proposal.html"&gt;objective&lt;/a&gt; of your talk.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Submit a complete, clear and compelling proposal. Show the reviewers that you
are willing to put in the effort to prepare for and to give a great
talk. Here are a &lt;a href="https://github.com/akaptur/pycon-proposals/tree/master/accepted"&gt;bunch of proposals&lt;/a&gt; to see and learn from.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Submit an outline along with your talk. Show the talk can be delivered in the
given time and will be interesting. Include an indication of how much &lt;a href="https://github.com/akaptur/pycon-proposals/blob/master/accepted/important_decisions_kaptur_2014.md#outline"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;
you intend to spend on each part of your talk.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Choose a good title.  The title is what catches the attention of your
audience when they are trying to pick a talk.  Avoid buzz words.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Get feedback. Like any writing, feedback can be helpful at all stages –
brainstorm while choosing topics to getting critique on the full abstract.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Convince the reviewers that you can give a &lt;a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/seven-tips-for-pycon/#note-to-the-organizers"&gt;well-rehearsed and entertaining&lt;/a&gt; –
link to previous talks you've given, include links to any testimonials you've
received from your audience, etc.  If you don't have a previously recorded
talk, give a small talk to your friends or colleagues and have it recorded.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyCon US has some &lt;a href="https://us.pycon.org/2016/speaking/talks/"&gt;good advice&lt;/a&gt; on how to submit a proposal and most of it is
generic enough for you to use for PyCon India, or any other conference.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;These posts (&lt;a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/tech-talks-are-campfires-jesses-three-reasons-you-should-speak-at-pycon/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/seven-tips-for-pycon/"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/tag/conference-tips/"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;) by Jesse Davis are so so good!
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I also liked &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/96692937"&gt;"The Talk on Talks"&lt;/a&gt; by Zach Holman.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
