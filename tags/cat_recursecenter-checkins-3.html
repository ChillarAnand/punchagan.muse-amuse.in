<li>Kyle and I did a demo of our spectrum analyzer/visualizer during the
presenations.  It was fun to work on, though we mostly just followed a
tutorial on the web, and made use of a bunch of libraries.
</li>
<li>I spent the night in HackerSchool.
</li>
<li>I was cleaning up the code in the tutorial we were trying to follow.
</li>
<li>Also, cleaned up the install.sh used by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/togiles/lightshowpi/src">lightshowpi</a> project to not do all the
ugly sudo setups, and use a Python virtualenv and install into that.
</li>
<li>Refactored the ugly looking music part of the tutorial into a smaller script
with only the functionality that we were going to use.
</li>
<li>We hit an interesting bug that would light up all the LEDs on the strip, once
in a while.  I didn't notice it during the night, because I had a "decay"
factor (the max factor by which the height of the columns should get reduced
between successive updates) was 0.9, but when the decay factor was reduced to
a lower value, it would happen quite often.  Also, we didn't see this
happening before.  So, we thought the bug was in the code I had written, when
I should have been sleeping. After reading and debugging my code for a bit,
with Kyle and Sean, I thought it was something hardware related that we were
doing wrong.  But, it turns out that a library we were using lit-up the whole
strip, when start and end values were both zero, instead of not lighting up
anything!
</li>
<li>Also, we hit another off-by one error, just before the demo. I didn't do the
math for splitting the strip into columns too carefully, and we hadn't
noticed the off-by one error until we taped up the strip into different
columns on a pillar for demo.
</li>
<li>There were some cool presentations by others.  I'll update the list on
Monday, since I currently don't remember them all!  Looking at the list of
names on the registration sheet would help!
</li>
<li>The cleaned up code is <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/90a238fedabcd88ba512">here</a>

<li>Started pairing with Kyle on his idea of building a spectrum analyzer on the
RaspberryPi using a LED Strip.  Both of us were fairly new to the RPi, and we
spent the morning, setting it up, and stepping through steps in <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-spectrum-analyzer-display-on-rgb-led-strip">this tutorial</a>.
</li>
<li>The tutorial, I felt, wasn't very well written, and definitely not suitable
for absolute beginners to start with.
</li>
<li>The code didn't seem to work for us, too.  The project put together a bunch
of libraries, in a way that someone who knew their way could follow along.
</li>
<li>Dana helped us and explained many things, about differences between SPI/GPIO,
and the precautions to take, helped us hook up stuff, etc.  It was great to
have her stepping in an helping every now and then!
</li>
<li>While Kyle was pairing on an Alum, I worked through the Graph Theory chapter
in the Think Complexity book, and read about the abrupt changes of
characteristics in random graphs, that were very similar and related to the
phenomenon in percolation theory that Nava explained.
</li>
<li>Later in the day, I played around with the python-googlevoice API, that
someone laboriously wrote after lot of careful html/xml parsing.
</li>
<li>I spent the night, refactoring the code to display random data on the
LEDStrip as a display of columns.  And then also ended up cleaning up the
setup scripts, and the way things need to be installed.

<li>Micheal demo-ed paredit mode in the emacs-club meetup, and I learnt a bunch
of things I didn't know about it.
</li>
<li>I added simpler tests (just one test, really) for <code>cinspect</code> using a dummy
module, and Tom started reviewing the code.  I wrapped up the code (for now),
until there is further interest in the project (in the form of issues/feature
requests).  I haven't yet announced it anywhere, but I probably should.
</li>
<li>I helped Teja (a friend of mine, not in HS) with a simple function to use
bisection to solve an equation.  He's just starting off with Python, and am
looking forward to see where he goes with it!
</li>
<li>I learned a few things about the V8 code base, thanks to sitting next to
Marcus, who is poking around with it.
</li>
<li>I started looking for other things to do, and went through a little bit of
the Audio programming book, but didn't do it for too long, until I stumbled
on <a href="http://greenteapress.com/complexity/">Think Complexity</a> and started reading it.  I read the introduction, and got
through a few of the exercises on Graphs.
</li>
<li>I also played around Flask-Sockets to help figure out answers to some
questions on Zulip, and was able to get a <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/53600958c1799c2dcf26">Hello World</a> working.
</li>
<li>In the process, I discovered the awesomeness of the gist-mode in emacs.  I
had always wanted gist plugins to let me list and update my previous gists,
but most of the plugins didn't seem to have it, or the feature wasn't very
discoverable.  I had tried writing something like that for Canopy, one or two
years ago.  Discovering that gist mode has this feature, was awesome!

the project.  But, he probably isn't that interested anymore since the code

<li>I didn't spend much time at Hacker School on Friday.  I reached a bit late
for the start of "Recursion day", and did a few problems.  The problems were
simple, but interesting.  After lunch, I headed home to start to Philly.

<li>Later in the day, I did some refactoring of the code to have the index reader
and writer split out.
</li>
<li>I also added a setup.py to be able to install the package using the standard
tools instead of PYTHONPATH hacks and stuff.
</li>
<li>During the refactoring, I again hit <i>this bug</i>.  I found out from Pankaj that
he has <code>from __future__ import print_function, absolute_imports</code> at the start
of his files these days.  I think I'm going to do it, too.

'utf-8' with replace, if that doesn't work either.

<li>I did a little clean up on the way the indexes were stored, to be able to

<li>As preparation for a one-on-one this week with one of the facilitators, I was
wondering if I was really getting better as a programmer, by doing what I am
doing.
</li>
<li>I have heard at numerous places that reading and reflection are keys to
getting better. I feel like I haven't been giving these things much attention
in the past couple of weeks. I don't catch up on reading all the awesome
reading material shared on Zulip and I switched from writing this blog post
first thing in the morning, to any-time-after-lunch. I don't think this
worked out very well. Writing the post worked as a way to reflect on what I
had done yesterday, and what I should be doing today. So, I am back to
writing the blog post, first thing in the morning!
</li>
<li>Yesterday, I worked on indexing the Python sources in a way that the
inspection code can look up, later.  During this process, I found that my
code to use libclang's AST wasn't generic enough, and I had to clean it up to
be able to extract useful information from any file in the <code>cpython</code> sources.
</li>
<li>We also got to attend a super-awesome talk by <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Labnik</a>! He talked about
his progression from being an application developer, to writing libraries, to
working on languages (as a professional developer). He made a lot of
interesting and inspiring points during his talk.  Some of those that stuck
with me are:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>None of these is particularly harder than any of the other. Depending on
each person's personality, or the way their brain works, they are good at
doing one or the other.
</li>
<li>Getting good at programming is a matter of showing up, more than about the
"genes".  He repeated quite a few times that he disliked the idea of "baby
hacker", and left out the story of his childhood and college programming
days! I'm totally stealing his idea of meeting every saturday at 1pm, with
a bunch of friends and working until it was 10pm or so, when they could get
cheap beer and food!  And he did this all through his college!  It is
interesting that this idea is so similar to Hacker School!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was a very enjoyable and inspiring talk on the whole.
</p>
</li>
<li>The plan for today is to actually have the parsed information dumped into
some persistent format, and modify the inspect code to actually use it.
</li>
<li>I will also be pairing with Kyle for a few hours on working through some of
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book">http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book</a>
