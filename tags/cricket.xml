My first Cricket match in a stadium. I regret that it was a
T-20. I'm happy, though, to have got the darshan of bhaiyya a.k.a
Sachin. Also, I did enjoy the energy of being in a stadium.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was actually intent on watching MI vs. RR, but, junta voted in
favor of the Opening Ceremony. It was a grandiloquent let-down,
but for the fireworks. There was nothing really spectacular about
the ceremony. A mediocre performanceâ€¦ With the kind of money
they have at hand, and have spent, I really would've liked
something better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The match. DC vs. KKR. DC lost a game that it could've comfortably
won. It would've been a decent match to watch, if not for the
stupid DJ-ing. The game looked so different from what I'm used to
seeing on the TV. [The only thing that was exactly as I saw in TV
was, the crowd drooling at the cheer girls.]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was shocked by the amount of disturbance a player has to
overcome, while playing. Has the "gentle-man's" game turned into a
"super-man's" game? Between each and every ball, the DJ is either
shouting some incomprehensible inanities or playing some crazy
"number" at the highest volume. The batsmen almost had to wait for
him to shut up, before each ball. Can someone tell me if these are
perks that the third version brings with it, or if I was happily
ignorant, thanks to the TV watching? The heart-beat sound in the
final overs was ridiculously annoying. I was looking forward to
one of the batsmen throwing his bat at the DJ.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also, it's a big joke to call this ground a "home" for DC. It was
nothing close to a home ground, in terms of the crowd. I don't see
Cuttack being any more homely, especially with the Kalinga Sena
already passing crazy orders to the cricketers. DC will have to
play exceedingly well to end-up anywhere near the top.  But,
amidst all this, I'm happy for the people of AP. With a huge
electric-power crisis looming ahead, they have already saved (or
produced) power worth 7 IPL matches!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also, this is the end of IPL v3 for me. I'm done with cricket for
this season.
&lt;/p&gt;
