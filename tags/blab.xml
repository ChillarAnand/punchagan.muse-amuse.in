It was a pleasant Saturday evening in the middle of the winter. Christmas was
just round the corner and love in the air. The sun was just setting and
everything outside his window was given a fresh coat of snow, tickled by the
red, quickly fading light. Not that he noticed. He stared blankly out of the
window, looking at nothing in particular. He had just woken up from his
afternoon nap; but he'd buy it if you told him he'd been sleeping for a year…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You could see the icy river crawling ahead, from his window.  People walking
over the bridge, a few camera flashes going off, people stopping over and
looking far ahead into the horizon – collecting their thoughts, couples
walking hand-in-hand enjoying each others' company; You could see it all, from
up there! But, as they say, you only see what you look for. And he, couldn't
see any of this. His looked out of his window and saw none of this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He is walking down the same bridge. He didn't know where he was going; his head
at least. His legs did; as always. He was walking down in his regular yellow
shirt and black jeans, that you could mistake for a uniform, if you followed
him for a few days. Extremely under-dressed for the chilly night, one would
say. He kept walking down the main street, lined with shops brightly lit up for
the festive season. The pavement bustled with with people walking with a spring
in their step – the spring that the festive season and all the love in the air
brought to you. Not that he noticed it, or had any of it in his step.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Soon, he's walking through the park. The park that was built to celebrate time,
ticking away furiously. Or to celebrate the time everyone in the world had, to
enjoy themselves. He walked past the skating rink, with lots of people having
the time of their life, ice skating; and a lot more, awaiting their turn. The
first timers, old and young, making up for their inexperience, with their
excitement; holding onto whatever they can, to finish each round, to start the
next! The veterans, taking the center-stage and showing off their moves!  He
was barely aware of their presence and just walked on, past all the action.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The music festival; he walked past it too, like the crowd didn't exist, the
noise didn't, the music didn't; like there was nothing happening! The fountain
"felt" no different. The cold breeze, did sprinkle the water to quite a
distance and everybody kept a safe distance to avoid the chilling shower,
except for the kids, who found it amusing to run into the shower for a split
second and run back madly. How could he walk just by it, and not feel a thing!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The lakefront. That is where his legs always brought him in the end. The
brilliantly lit skyline was a delight to watch, but I don't believe he saw any
of it. He just stared into it, blankly. He kept staring, as the night got
chillier and the surroundings kept getting more and more deserted. Seconds
ticked away, minutes and hours passed by! He stayed on, staring ahead. It
didn't matter how much below zero the mercury had gone. This wasn't the first
night he was spending staring into the nothingness. It turned out to be the
coldest night, in a decade. But that didn't matter to him. Nothing did. Nothing
has, for a while now; Ever since he turned cold.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blab</category><category>cold</category><category>fiction</category><category>life</category><category>story</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/cold.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2013 19:33:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Unread (8,762)</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/unread-8762.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I am unread.  Unlike you, who classify yourselves as well-read or
not, I am classified as unread or not.  Well, you could call me
not well-read too, I guess.  I was looked at once, my innards
glanced through, and was hurriedly marked as unread, starred and
tagged.  Given my length, the care with which I was composed, and
the flurry with which I was stowed away, I probably contain
something important, to be read at the opportune moment, something
to be cherished and to be replied to with diligence and care.  I
felt a sense of pride.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I got composed and sent weeks ago, and have been lying here
untouched, since.  I get buried deeper and deeper every day, with
a daily flood of newer stuff piling up onto me.  While my
composer, eagerly awaits a reply, (less and less eagerly each day,
though) I have lost all hope of being read and replied to.  I
curse myself for carrying something so important.  A thousand
other replies have been sent, and a few thousand others composed
here, but my turn hasn't come, yet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How I wish, it'd be my turn today.  How I wish, I could push my
way up through to the top of the stack.  How I wish, I could see
the eager wait come to an end!  How I wish, I'm given the
attention I deserved, today!  Reply, ASAP!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
PS: Apologies for all those emails that are still starred and
unread, in my Inbox…

I'm not the body that dies&lt;br&gt;
on missing a beat or one breath.&lt;br&gt;
I'm not the mind, so fickle,&lt;br&gt;
I'm in heaven one moment, and next in hell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm the moments I live,&lt;br&gt;
not the ones, in which I just exist.&lt;br&gt;
I'm the dreams I dream,&lt;br&gt;
those fulfilled, and not just yet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am the occasions I grace&lt;br&gt;
and those, missed, where I am.&lt;br&gt;
I am the words I spoke,&lt;br&gt;
those I wrote, and those I will.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am all that I create,&lt;br&gt;
and the stuff that I catalyse.&lt;br&gt;
I am the love I receive,&lt;br&gt;
and all of it that I spread.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Don't cry, when I die,&lt;br&gt;
for I never really will.&lt;br&gt;

I now have a GNU! I bought it (a GNU soft toy) in memory of my friend
swathanthran from #emacs-in.  RIP swathanthran
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a bonus, I got the chance to have a photograph with just RMS and
me. Also, hoping the monetary contribution will be of some use to
FSF-India.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The thrill of getting the GNU (and the GNU itself) and shaking hands,
getting photographed with RMS is dedicated to all the lafoots and
specially to Voodoo, who taught me the meaning of the word "hacker".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Happy Hacking!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
ps: I just hope and pray nobody else does anything as stupid and
shocking as what swathanthran did.

Well, it's been a week of lull on my blog.  Not that I'm very
busy.  But, just didn't have anything to post.  I was feeling jobless
today and searched the web for org2blog users.  Here is what I found.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a test post from org2blog
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Posting from emacs and org-mode
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Vim vs Emacs, or why it really doesn’t matter
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Posting subtree from org-mode buffer (take 2)
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Here’s a test post to wordpress for Org2blog – an Emacs plugin
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Primeiro post usando org2blog
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Emacs中绘图－ ditaa篇
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;org2blog on identi.ca
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;del&gt;I'd&lt;/del&gt; We had been on a 60 km long trip today. My second one, and
Ritesh's first. The map of our route is here. On the whole the ride
was wonderful! A thoroughly enjoyable one. It was near perfect, with
it raining only as much as we enjoyed an not anymore. :)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ride on Godbander Road was the most enjoyable part of the
ride. Simple Wonderful! That's what made the trip worth it!
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It was more relaxed than my previous ride and it took us about 5
hours on the whole. We must've been pedalling for about 4 hours. I
don't have the "actual" figures.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Except for the stretch of Western express highway (service road)
from Jogeshwari to a little after the Sanjay Gandhi National park's
entrance, the road was decent. The Eastern Express highway service
road was awesome!
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cycling alone is totally different from cycling with someone
else. We didn't really go together, but we were meeting up once in a
while. The loneliness, of rides on which you are alone, is
absent. But waiting for, or catching up with the other guy is a bit
tricky. I wonder how it would be with a bigger group.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I tried to keep going at about 60% effort and I still had quite a
bit of juice left in me, at the end of the ride.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;My cycle is definitely good! I really only understood this after
exchanging my cycle.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Exchanging cycles felt nice. A slightly different set of muscles
were in action. The newness kinda helped.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I should probably get myself a bigger round frame spectacles. Or I'm
craning my neck a bit too much, to keep looking ahead, while
pedaling. How about contacts?
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The problem with riding on the left of Highways is that you
"compete" with heavy vehicles. It sometimes gets a bit scary.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I should get a helmet soon.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I should get in touch with local cycling groups and tag along with
them on a couple of rides. I'll get to learn a lot of things.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ritesh took a few pics with his phone. &lt;del&gt;Photos in some later post or
with an update&lt;/del&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Where to next? A ride inside the National park, probably or the
wonderful roads of Navi Mumbai.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Kudos Ritesh!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt; A few pictures, that Ritesh clicked on his phone. All the
photos were on the Godbander Road.
&lt;/p&gt;

After a short break, I'm back to blogging!
A few things have changed meanwhile. A lot haven't.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noetic Nought shall now be called Rustic Reverie.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Blogs I read page is now manually populated. More pages might be
coming soon.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;My web presence has almost been reduced to just this blog. I hope to
be blogging more often this time around. I guess I'll have shorter
and more frequent posts. "Release early, Release often."
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I've been inspired by Sacha Chua and her wonderful blog. She puts up
anything that -
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;she may look up in future.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;could be remotely useful to anybody on this planet.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like her idea of "thinking of writing as sketching". "Keep
repeating yourself, until the core message floats to the top". It
feels similar to the idea - "Release early, Release often."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Also, Thanks to Madhu and Vattam who set an impossibly high standard
by having their resumes and letters of recommendations and other
"personal" stuff on version control on public repositories.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All my posts will be made from org2blog - a little org-mode based
client that I hacked up. Emacs and Org-mode all the way! This is the
first post by me (and probably anybody) from org2blog!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><category>blab</category><category>first</category><category>org2blog</category><category>web</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/im-back.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2010 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hibernation</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/hibernation.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I, Noetic Nought, shall remain shut for the next few months.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My owner wishes to be a by-stander, watching the world rush past
him, for the next few months atleast. He may (or not) return to
me. I hope, he does.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Bye all.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blab</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/hibernation.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2010 17:04:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Blogs, Feeds and Readers</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/blogs-feeds-and-readers.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I want to be a part of the "reader-space" of blogs or web-sites
rather than a part of the Google-reader ecosystem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As most of my readers know, I'm big on Google Reader (and I have a
reputation for that!). I'm a part of a wonderful ecosystem and get
to look-at or read a lot of interesting stuff. I get a lot of
variety, stuff that I wouldn't normally have come across. It keeps
me from staying in a tiny well, reading the same kind of stuff,
over and over again. I also like the fact that it acts as an
archival system for me. I can go back and read posts, which don't
exist on the web, anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, I have a problem with this ecosystem. It's killing the the
communities around the blogs or sites, themselves. The reader
count may have gone up, but the discussion and activity of the
community on the blogs is going down; at least on the blogs I look
at. Blogs are rather dead, these days. But, when one's following
over 200 blogs, you can't expect much better. It is difficult to
keep up with all of them; even the ones that one kept up well
with, before. People stop going back to the comments; stop
participating in the discussion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Do you agree? Do you think it'll help it feed readers keep track
of the comments and updates? Or is the only way to cut down on
feed-reading and getting back to the old exciting way of checking
out blogs? I recall an old quote I read - If it's not worth
remembering, it's not worth reading.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt; I wasn't talking of my blog or comments here, in
 particular (if that's not already clear). I was talking of blogs,
 that I read regularly, blogs of people I know well (including
 mine). But then, there are blogs, that have over 1000 comments on
 a single post, too. Should the above quote could be changed to
 read - "If it's not worth reading, it's not worth remembering." ?
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blab</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/blogs-feeds-and-readers.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2010 16:59:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Just another bunch</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/just-another-bunch.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p class="verse"&gt;
Come spring -&lt;br&gt;
a fresh lease of green&lt;br&gt;
drapes the bare branches.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The leaves, dancing and whistling&lt;br&gt;
to the tunes of the wind&lt;br&gt;
playing, screaming, and singing,&lt;br&gt;
in each other's company, enjoying.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Singing to one another&lt;br&gt;
promises of sticking together,&lt;br&gt;
come what may, through it all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The song goes on,&lt;br&gt;
but the count goes down,&lt;br&gt;
not noticed or just unacknowledged,&lt;br&gt;
first by one and then by many more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the song, still, goes on.&lt;br&gt;
And the promises too, of course.&lt;br&gt;
The song goes on and on and on.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Until silence falls upon, when all&lt;br&gt;
of them are gone. The tree, knowing well,&lt;br&gt;
watches on - it won't be long before&lt;br&gt;
a new bunch springs up to sing the song.&lt;br&gt;
