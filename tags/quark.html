Back again with another khichdi of a post.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Quark, Waves and Apogee. [For the uninitiated, Quark is our
technical festival and Waves, our Cul-fest] I had been to
BITS-Pilani, for attending their Tech-fest, Apogee.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One would expect Apogee to end up the best, but we were
thoroughly disappointed. It came nowhere near the perfection
of Quark and things seemed quite unprofessional. Hats-off to
Chaitu n others in the Quark Org-Co. I'm already worried
about missing Quark'09 [thanks to my PS]
</li>
<li>The specials at all three events were unforgettable. Feeding
the Fish, the Air Shows (Naval and Amateur planes), the
Orchestral performance, Special Performance [Aasra], Sand
art by Gagan and Mithali!
</li>
<li>Had the opportunity, to meet/have a look at some of the guys
studying at colleges in their home towns. For once, I felt
being in a "reputed", national college does matter.
</li>
<li>Felt good spending some time with good ol' friends at
Pilani.
</li>
<li>Always believed organizing events isn't my forte, but,
helped organize a couple of events at Quark. Feels good.
</li>
<li>Effective Communication is less about how well you choose
your words but more about your quantum of concern for the
other person and the matter at hand!
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Pilani Campus, Love at First sight. Never really felt like
coming back.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The arts/non-technical clubs there are simply superb! We
have a lot to learn
</li>
<li>Cycling on campus. A dream come true!
</li>
<li>All Night Canteen is a real hangout place!
</li>
<li>Green, Greener, Greenest. Never really felt like we were in
the deserts of Rajasthan.
</li>
<li>…. the list can go on and on. I'll stop here.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>FOSS n me.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Attended my first FOSS event! The Install Fest @
Quark. Wasn't as awe inspiring as I would've liked it to be,
but still a memorable one. Simply for being my first
install-fest and for the lessons we learnt.
</li>
<li>FOSSKriti'08 is one event I'll regret missing. It was
absolutely amazing. I'm just hoping, people here too get to
that level soon enough.
</li>
<li>Free Software and Freeware ain't the same stuff. It's
extremely painful when people address FOSS stuff as
freeware. Free Software is Software that's Free as in Free
Speech n Freeware is software that if free as in free beer.
</li>
<li>Eagerly awaiting mukt.in v2. Can't wait to get back home!
</li>
<li>Enjoying my time on \\#mukt.in and \\#linux-india. The new DC
hub (GNOME) for FOSS junta is cool too!
</li>
<li>There's an urgent need to start contributing to FOSS. But
how?
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Haven't yet found myself an intern/project for summer. Wonder
what's in store, this summer.
</li>
<li>Most of the gang's On-Campus next sem. Will really miss Voodoo
though. Hoping he has a rocking PS.
</li>
<li>Hoping we won't have to shift hostels next sem.
</li>
<li>Appreciation is a great motivator. Expressing it promptly is
important. I'm bad at it. Should work on it.
</li>
<li>"The gang" is like a flock of birds in flight.
</li>
<li>This semester is coming to an end already, and I don't have
anything I'd be proud of.
</li>
<li>Wonder why I have absolutely no feelings about the farewell we'd
be having soon.
</li>
<li>Awaiting Ugadi Celebs. Seems like they are gonna rock more than
ever.
</li>
<li>Gone are those days, when I used to post because something I had
to write about, compelled me to do so. These days, the long
inactivity on my blog is turning out to be the sole reason for
my posts. [A few Rare Exceptions though, and this one isn't] I
wonder if its because life's become uneventful or because I grew
lazier or because of something else.
</li>
<li>I don't like posting accounts of events from the recent/distant
past, but I'm doing it just to prevent my blog's death.
</li>

Another post, with nothing concrete to say…
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>These are just a few random musings, for those curious about my
life and for the good health of my Blog which is so close to its
death..
</li>
<li>College (+ Hostel) is amongst few places, that everyone on
Earth(&amp; elsewhere) \\*must\\* get the chance to be in. There's a
whole new world out here, with hell a lotuva things you can do,
Here and Only Here… [I am not, by any means, talking of
acads!]
</li>
<li>Projects. Yes they are a part of almost all my random
stuff… cos I just Love them, when they are self-assigned and
off-hand. They get even more exciting, when the learning curve
is Steep!
</li>
<li>Deadlines can be wonderful things, if only I learn to respect
them.
</li>
<li>Lab-Tests, i guess, are amongst the most hyped tests in the
World! They aren't worth all that fuss.
</li>
<li>Grades ain't everything in Life. Not even if you are doing
Engineering!
</li>
<li>I live amidst /wonderful* singers, <b>marvelous</b> music composers,
<b>facile</b> lyric writers, <b>cool</b> Hackers, <b>amazing</b> photographers,
<b>inspiring</b> poets and what not. [Why the hell do people then,
look just for the *"industrious"/ grade scorers?]
</li>
<li>Music and Sleep are Great Healers. Laughter, too, is a close
competitor.
</li>
<li>GNU/Linux is addictive. More n more people getting addicted,
everyday!
</li>
<li>RHCE's got a pretty interesting test. Its rare to be interested
in undergoing the torture of a test, ain't it?
</li>
<li>Rules seem to be total crap, until you get the chance to look at
them from above.
</li>
<li>Quark'08 coming up! Gottu gear up for it!
</li>
<li>Comprees?? They don't bother me so much any more.
</li>
<li>Finally, for those who found all the above stuff boring and
dumb… here's some food for thought &gt; The Best things in Life
aren't Things…
</li>

Revelations..Revelations…Revelations.
</p>

<p>
Such wonderful things they are… bringing to us.. such a joy
[even if its about something not so pleasant…]… the joy of
discovering things.. of realising a truth… that was hidden
somewhere within… brought out with an elegant swoooosh!!…
</p>

<p>
We, 9, Voodoo, Ravi, UC n me] were just walking on the
street… enjoying the evening… after a nice day @ Quark [Day
2]… We were having a casual discussion… not discussing
anything in particular… but somehow the discussion led to a
project uc,ravi n me [ and probably the others are too..(they
didn't talk abt it…)] are interested in… [i don't wanna give
any more info abt the project.. bcos it may seem over-ambitious to
a few.. not that it hasn't been done already…. but…]
neways….
</p>

<p>
so… while we were talkin abt it… uc said, he didn't have any
clue about that thing worked… and we all were wondering
too… thinking about some possible solutions/methods….[I was
actually trying to recollect something i came across… some time
back…] but then suddenly 9 jumped in, to say…
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Don't think about how 'that' works… Just think about how 'YOU'
would make it work!!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh my God!! now that's what's a REVELATION… I was just
dumb-struck… that one small statement of his… drowned me in
its depths… I feel I still haven't come out of it… A big big
revelation at the most unexpected of times, at the most unexpected
of places…. [though 9 wouldn't agree with this… being his
usual modest self…]
</p>

<p>
Its been proved time and again… "they" can occur
anywhere… anytime and to anyone… while you are on the
street.. in your room.. at work… or even in the loo… [Most ppl
have a lot of them here!!].. we just need to keep our eyes n ears
open… and most importantly our Mind……  ps: it seems…me not
delving out the details about our ambitious project.. makes this
post a little vague, uninteresting n difficult to relate to… but
still…  In the fields of observation chance favors only the
prepared mind –Louis Pasteur

This post is to promote QUARK'07… This post is here… little
due to my desire.. and almost totally bcos somebody [the ppl here
at coll..] expect "us" to do it..
</p>

<p>
Blogspot.. Orkut..[i don't use it any more] were blocked on campus
[don't ask why cos none of us have been able to figure
out.. atleast about Blogspot..] but the blocks have been lifted
for a fortnight.. just so that we can publicise Quark [our
techfest..] Its from 17th March to 19th March.. check out the link
for more details..

<p>
So ppl.. Quark coming up :)…

<p>
and… blocks coming up too :(…
