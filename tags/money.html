No.  Not the Obama change.  I'm talking of change as in small
denominations of cash.  Everybody is reluctant to part with
it.  There's always a problem with getting it.  I'm often worried
before getting into a bus or an auto, or going to a shop whether
or not the guy would give me change for a 50, 100 or a 500.
People so reluctant to "part" with it. What are they saving it
for?
</p>

<p>
I think the situation would be much better if people readily gave
it, when required.  There would be a free flow and if not anything
more, I wouldn't have to worry about it when going somewhere.
But, I "feel" this would actually reduce the instances when both
the parties don't have enough change with them. What do you think?

My first Cricket match in a stadium. I regret that it was a
T-20. I'm happy, though, to have got the darshan of bhaiyya a.k.a
Sachin. Also, I did enjoy the energy of being in a stadium.
</p>

<p>
I was actually intent on watching MI vs. RR, but, junta voted in
favor of the Opening Ceremony. It was a grandiloquent let-down,
but for the fireworks. There was nothing really spectacular about
the ceremony. A mediocre performance… With the kind of money
they have at hand, and have spent, I really would've liked
something better.
</p>

<p>
The match. DC vs. KKR. DC lost a game that it could've comfortably
won. It would've been a decent match to watch, if not for the
stupid DJ-ing. The game looked so different from what I'm used to
seeing on the TV. [The only thing that was exactly as I saw in TV
was, the crowd drooling at the cheer girls.]
</p>

<p>
I was shocked by the amount of disturbance a player has to
overcome, while playing. Has the "gentle-man's" game turned into a
"super-man's" game? Between each and every ball, the DJ is either
shouting some incomprehensible inanities or playing some crazy
"number" at the highest volume. The batsmen almost had to wait for
him to shut up, before each ball. Can someone tell me if these are
perks that the third version brings with it, or if I was happily
ignorant, thanks to the TV watching? The heart-beat sound in the
final overs was ridiculously annoying. I was looking forward to
one of the batsmen throwing his bat at the DJ.
</p>

<p>
Also, it's a big joke to call this ground a "home" for DC. It was
nothing close to a home ground, in terms of the crowd. I don't see
Cuttack being any more homely, especially with the Kalinga Sena
already passing crazy orders to the cricketers. DC will have to
play exceedingly well to end-up anywhere near the top.  But,
amidst all this, I'm happy for the people of AP. With a huge
electric-power crisis looming ahead, they have already saved (or
produced) power worth 7 IPL matches!
</p>

<p>
Also, this is the end of IPL v3 for me. I'm done with cricket for
this season.

I was travelling in a bus today, when I overheard two people
sitting behind me. One of the guy was telling the other about his
brother's job and the hardships he faces. The guy they were
talking about, practically risks his life, to be able to eat a
square meal. He works on Billboards, used to paint them and now
that there aren't enough people who get them painted, pastes the
vinly posters on to the boards.
</p>

<p>
All day a guy struggles hard, to transform an ugly looking, old
hoarding into a huge attractive advertisement and he is paid so
well, that he has to slog it out to make ends meet for his family
of four. They who get the paintings made or the posters put up,
are striking it rich with loads of money and fame. Those who drive
by, are having a good time watching that beautiful looking woman
there or fantasizing themselves in that wonderful car up
there. Then why is this person here, who slogs it out, making so
many people happy, struggling to see a smile on his daughter?
</p>

<p>
When people around can get paid handsomely for having a jolly time
in the air-conditioned room, puking out a few lines of code each
day, can't this guy, sweating it out in this may heat, get a
better deal? Isn't there something fundamentally wrong
somewhere?

A DJ nite's going on here.. for WAVES…. I just went there for a
while….  The arrangements were pretty good… with Huge huge
huge spks.. [I can still hear the Music quite loud.. sitting here
in my room.. which is quite a distance form the Venue…] There's
real Heart throbbing music [Literally… With speakers of over
15000W your heart really throbs… dub.. dub.. dub…] being
played there…
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering if we really needed such extravagant
stuff… I know that such events bring ppl together… but do we
need to spend so much money just to have a have a good dance with
friends?? When a large number of people aren't able to get their
basic neccessities like a Square Meal, Clean drinking water,
proper clothing and shelter… here we are enjoying a good dance
with friends… with elaborately made extravagant
arrangements… [of course the money isn't ours… but…] [ I
know a lot of guys wud've a lot to say against me…. but.. its
ok..]
</p>

<p>
There can't be perfect equality in this world… of which duality
is an integral part…. every elementary particle has a dual
nature… so its but obvious that every thing in this world has a
dual to it… so its not possible to have a perfect world with
everybody equally placed.. if there is a rich.. then there will be
a poor… if there is joy.. then there will be despair… if there
is light.. then there will be darkness…
</p>

<p>
But can't we do anything… can't we spread the light to every
place that we possibly could?? Can't we get together to minimize
the difference? Join the race against nature… do your bit…
</p>

<p>
This, probably, is a good place to start off…
