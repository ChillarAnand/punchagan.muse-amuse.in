The ideal presentation should be aimed at an audience of gentleman
and lady programmers—smart, and generally capable but without,
necessarily, any specific knowledge of the domain from which the
code comes. Presentations should provide enough context for the
audience to to understand what the code is and should explain any
details of the implementation language that may be obscure to the
average programmer.

Git can be accurately understood as a fairly simple functional data
structure. Instead of explaining Git in terms version control, we
can see the ability to do version control as an emergent property of
using that data structure. I think talking about Git in this manner
will more accurately convey the simplicity and power of Git better
than any comparisons with centralized version control systems can
accomplish.

Perhaps the wars, poverty, fights for freedom and little miracles of
the past have lessons for us that we can use today?

<p>
Learning to code is merely teaching people to spell.
</p>

<p>
Computer Science is about what makes a poem beautiful, why
alliteration is alluring, how iambic pentameter unlocks the secrets
of Shakespeare.

<p>
how do you determine a need that isn't being fulfilled and might be
the basis for a project/business? Two ways. You could ask people
what problems they have that you might be able to help solve, or
(for introverts like me) examine what processes or services feel
needlessly difficult in your own life.

<p>
Dewey-Hagborg’s work is super interesting, not to mention searingly
contemporary. “It’s a very accessible way for the public to engage
with this new technology. It really brings to light how powerful it
is, the idea that a hair from your head can fall on your street and
a perfect stranger can pick it up and know something about it,” she
says, adding: “With DNA sequencing becoming faster and cheaper, this
is the world we’re all going to be living in.”

Standing up all day can be tough at first, but I'm much happier
working like that. Plus, when you finally switch off at night,
you'll feel like you've done more than just think and type.

If the counter is displayed during the meeting, then everyone can
decide whether or not the meeting is generating a sensible
return. Whoever has the courage to call off a meeting on the grounds
it probably isn't worth it should get 10% of the expected meeting
costs saved to spend on a project of their choice (no meetings
allowed ;-).
