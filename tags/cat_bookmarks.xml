&lt;p&gt;
The ideal presentation should be aimed at an audience of gentleman
and lady programmers—smart, and generally capable but without,
necessarily, any specific knowledge of the domain from which the
code comes. Presentations should provide enough context for the
audience to to understand what the code is and should explain any
details of the implementation language that may be obscure to the
average programmer.

As reported in various places, there was an incident in early
November where commits in our Git repositories have become misplaced
temporarily by accident. By the mid next week we were able to
resurrect all the commits and things are back to normal now.

Open source is about the people involved. Code can be replaced,
re-written, even removed completely, and the project will continue
to move forward. The open source community is made up of people who
have dedicated their time and their life to see its success.

&lt;p&gt;
Git can be accurately understood as a fairly simple functional data
structure. Instead of explaining Git in terms version control, we
can see the ability to do version control as an emergent property of
using that data structure. I think talking about Git in this manner
will more accurately convey the simplicity and power of Git better
than any comparisons with centralized version control systems can
accomplish.
