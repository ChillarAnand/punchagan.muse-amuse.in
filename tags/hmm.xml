&lt;li&gt;This Friday we worked on building our own URL shorteners.  It was a fun
exercise, and I built one that is not persistent, in the two hours.  I worked
on a not so important problem of having sorted query parameters, instead of
the more important problem of having a persistent server.  Anyway, I should
be building something that works, first, before trying to solve the more
interesting problems.  At least on Fridays.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched this old but interesting talk by Brandon Rhodes, titled &lt;a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/276/the-mighty-dictionary-55"&gt;The Mighty
Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;, and played around with his &lt;a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon2010-mighty-dictionary/blob/master/figures/_dictinfo.py"&gt;_dictinfo&lt;/a&gt; module after-wards.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent the rest of the evening reading up about Markov chains and Hidden
Markov Models. I'm happy to finally understand what these terms mean, after
seeing them being thrown around for so many years!
&lt;/li&gt;
