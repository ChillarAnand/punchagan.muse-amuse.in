<li>Kyle and I did a demo of our spectrum analyzer/visualizer during the
presenations.  It was fun to work on, though we mostly just followed a
tutorial on the web, and made use of a bunch of libraries.
</li>
<li>I spent the night in HackerSchool.
</li>
<li>I was cleaning up the code in the tutorial we were trying to follow.
</li>
<li>Also, cleaned up the install.sh used by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/togiles/lightshowpi/src">lightshowpi</a> project to not do all the
ugly sudo setups, and use a Python virtualenv and install into that.
</li>
<li>Refactored the ugly looking music part of the tutorial into a smaller script
with only the functionality that we were going to use.
</li>
<li>We hit an interesting bug that would light up all the LEDs on the strip, once
in a while.  I didn't notice it during the night, because I had a "decay"
factor (the max factor by which the height of the columns should get reduced
between successive updates) was 0.9, but when the decay factor was reduced to
a lower value, it would happen quite often.  Also, we didn't see this
happening before.  So, we thought the bug was in the code I had written, when
I should have been sleeping. After reading and debugging my code for a bit,
with Kyle and Sean, I thought it was something hardware related that we were
doing wrong.  But, it turns out that a library we were using lit-up the whole
strip, when start and end values were both zero, instead of not lighting up
anything!
</li>
<li>Also, we hit another off-by one error, just before the demo. I didn't do the
math for splitting the strip into columns too carefully, and we hadn't
noticed the off-by one error until we taped up the strip into different
columns on a pillar for demo.
</li>
<li>There were some cool presentations by others.  I'll update the list on
Monday, since I currently don't remember them all!  Looking at the list of
names on the registration sheet would help!
</li>
<li>The cleaned up code is <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/90a238fedabcd88ba512">here</a>

<li>I wrote up a README since David (an alum at Hacker School) showed interest in
the project.  But, he probably isn't that interested anymore since the code
base is Python2.x only.
</li>
<li>I got rid of assumptions that method names would start with the module name
or the type name, and actually look up references to the names in the
definitions of types or objects.
</li>
<li>I also improved the test-suite to actually download sources of CPython and
index them.  They take very very long!!

<li>I didn't spend much time at Hacker School on Friday.  I reached a bit late
for the start of "Recursion day", and did a few problems.  The problems were
simple, but interesting.  After lunch, I headed home to start to Philly.
</li>
<li>Later in the day, I did some refactoring of the code to have the index reader
and writer split out.
</li>
<li>I also added a setup.py to be able to install the package using the standard
tools instead of PYTHONPATH hacks and stuff.
</li>
<li>During the refactoring, I again hit <i>this bug</i>.  I found out from Pankaj that
he has <code>from __future__ import print_function, absolute_imports</code> at the start
of his files these days.  I think I'm going to do it, too.

<li>Unicode issues: it turned out that (atleast) one of the files had a character
that wasn't UTF-8 encoded. I got around it by trying 'utf-8', if not falling
back to 'iso-8859-1'.  Now that I think about it, I should fallback to
'utf-8' with replace, if that doesn't work either.

<li>I did a little clean up on the way the indexes were stored, to be able to
have a <code>getfile</code>, to mimic <code>inspect</code>'s API.

formatter/colorizer to not break with C modules.

<li>As preparation for a one-on-one this week with one of the facilitators, I was
wondering if I was really getting better as a programmer, by doing what I am
doing.
</li>
<li>I have heard at numerous places that reading and reflection are keys to
getting better. I feel like I haven't been giving these things much attention
in the past couple of weeks. I don't catch up on reading all the awesome
reading material shared on Zulip and I switched from writing this blog post
first thing in the morning, to any-time-after-lunch. I don't think this
worked out very well. Writing the post worked as a way to reflect on what I
had done yesterday, and what I should be doing today. So, I am back to
writing the blog post, first thing in the morning!
</li>
<li>Yesterday, I worked on indexing the Python sources in a way that the
inspection code can look up, later.  During this process, I found that my
code to use libclang's AST wasn't generic enough, and I had to clean it up to
be able to extract useful information from any file in the <code>cpython</code> sources.
</li>
<li>We also got to attend a super-awesome talk by <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Labnik</a>! He talked about
his progression from being an application developer, to writing libraries, to
working on languages (as a professional developer). He made a lot of
interesting and inspiring points during his talk.  Some of those that stuck
with me are:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>None of these is particularly harder than any of the other. Depending on
each person's personality, or the way their brain works, they are good at
doing one or the other.
</li>
<li>Getting good at programming is a matter of showing up, more than about the
"genes".  He repeated quite a few times that he disliked the idea of "baby
hacker", and left out the story of his childhood and college programming
days! I'm totally stealing his idea of meeting every saturday at 1pm, with
a bunch of friends and working until it was 10pm or so, when they could get
cheap beer and food!  And he did this all through his college!  It is
interesting that this idea is so similar to Hacker School!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was a very enjoyable and inspiring talk on the whole.
</p>
</li>
<li>The plan for today is to actually have the parsed information dumped into
some persistent format, and modify the inspect code to actually use it.
</li>
<li>I will also be pairing with Kyle for a few hours on working through some of
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book">http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book</a>

I took it easy during the weekend, and went on a nice camp with my a cousin's
family to TobyHanna State Park for a day or so, and spent the remaining (long)
weekend at their place in PA.  It was a pretty nice break!
</p>

<p>
Yesterday evening, I talked to Madhu about how ugly my code looked while I was
trying to use <code>libclang</code>, and he told me that he found a lot of wrapped C++/C
libraries end up being that way, and I also realized that using the Python AST
library seemed much cleaner, because it just contained Python objects, but
representing C/C++ objects in an AST and interacting with them in Python, isn't
that clean.
</p>

<p>
I cleaned up my code, and removed all the ugly regexes to use libclang to do
the parsing of the libs, and get the source code.  I basically got all the
tests passing, but they were taking an order of magnitude longer to run.  So, I
guess the next step is to cache things somehow.
</p>

<p>
I also added support for viewing the sources of built-in types.  It was pretty
simple, once I had everything working with libclang.

work too well with the Python's sources.
</li>
<li>I later went to the New York Public Library to see <a href="http://www.nypl.org/press/press-release/2013/06/26/new-york-public-library-display-historic-copies-declaration-independe">a copy of the Declaration

enable posting to different channels on zulip.
</li>
<li>I learnt a few things about Django.  Commented out references to views that
don't exists breaks templating.  Formsets didn't seem very convenient to use,
for editing data showing the user only partial forms.
</li>
<li>I played around with Clang for a bit, to try and use libclang to parse the C
code for inspection, instead of writing one myself.  It sometimes feels like
an overkill, but it feels like it'll make the whole code more robust.  I'm
not sure.  I'll need to play around for a bit more to decide.
</li>
<li>I also finally got around to fix the resolution of my tty shells.  I was in a
bus, and wanted my laptop's battery to last longer, and decided to use a tty
shell with just emacs running. But, the resolution sucked.  So, I
fixed. Essentially it involved removing a blacklist file that an old version
of Nvidia drivers left behind in
<code>/usr/share/grub-gfxpayload-lists/blacklist/</code> and setting
<code>GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080</code> in <code>/etc/default/grub</code>.
