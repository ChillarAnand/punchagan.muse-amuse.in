<p>
A few days back, a couple of friends and I were discussing, how
anything sells in India and how opening a restaurant is seemingly
an easy way to make some quick bucks.  But, now, I have a much
better plan to make some big money, may be not so quickly, but
definitely a lot more – at least by an order of magnitude.
</p>

<p>
Religion!  Nothing sells like it, in the land of snake charmers!
People will buy anything on offer.  This post gives the recipe for
turning a small temple in a <span class="underline">god forsaken</span> town, into a big place
of worship that "attracts" devotees from all over the country, if
not the world!
</p>

<p>
The first task would be to zero-in on a temple.  But before that,
let's define the kind of town we are interested in.  Ideally, the
town should be within a couple of hundred kilometers away from a
city with good transport connectivity and a population at around
one and a half million (There are about 20 such cities, in the
country).  The temple in question could piggy back on the fame of
a temple nearby, if it is within about 50 kilometers of a really
famous temple, but in that case, our temple would remain the
second preference, for a very long time to come.  But this is much
easier to accomplish and arguably a quicker buck.  Ideally,
though, we'd prefer a location, which doesn't have any other
famous temples in the radius of about 300 kms (roughly 5-6 hours
by road).  It also helps if the travel to the temple for the big
city is through the country side, giving a glimpse of the country
side that urban Indians can only dream of connecting, the life
that was once lived by their parents and grandparents, but they
now only get to see in the movies.  This will help us score some
points with the "educated and sophisticated" urban populace.
</p>

<p>
Now, the temple.  It should be the biggest or the only one in
town, though having smaller temples around helps in knitting more
tales around the temple.  The temple in question should be one,
that the locals have tremendous faith in.  You should be able to
find at least a dozen people who vouch for the miraculous power of
the gods in there, without trying too hard.  That should be good
enough, to get you going, and I believe this isn't too hard for
any random temple, anywhere in the country.
</p>

<p>
The gods.  It really doesn't matter who the god is.  He/she could
either be a generalist or a specialist and that would influence
the type of crowds coming in.  Your god can be as specialized as
you like, up to the extent of specializing in blessing people get
visas to the US.  Now, your god can either be an already well
known god, or a not so well known incarnation of a well known god,
or a new person who is soon to become god!  The first type is a
hard bet; the third option is somewhat high risk too, and you'll
really need to put your mind to it, to make it work.  The second
option is the easiest one.  It always helps to have some real
objects and places that can be associated with the god, and are
living proof that the god once lived here and used those things.
It really helps if you can give the devotees the feeling that they
are doing all the things that the god in question once used to do,
at the same places he/she used to do it.  Type-3 gods would work
well for this.
</p>

<p>
Spread the word.  This, obviously, is the most important part and
the hardest one too.  It's best to start with the word of mouth.
Start with family and friends and friends of friends and friends
of friends of friends (read as facebook-only-friends).  Pick the
more religious of the lot, encourage them to visit the place,
write and share blog posts/tweets/pictures/tales/stories and
whatever else, with them.  Encourage them to interact with the
locals.  I don't think it would be necessary to make any deals
with the locals.  They are smart enough, wherever you go!  You
need to actively market your god, until a critical mass of happy
devotees, has been reached.  A critical mass is reached, when
there are more people talking of their wishes coming true, than
there are people who are still waiting for their wishes to come
true.  This should be too hard given that, religious people tend
to believe that whatever happens, happens for the best and god has
better plans for them, than their own.  Slowly, you could coax one
of the better writers (who is also religious?) into writing a book
or two about your temple.  A couple of years after selling your
book, you should try and encourage one of the big TV houses to
make a teleserial based on the book, and that would be it!  Now,
you can sit back and relax.
</p>

<p>
While getting all of the above right is important, it is also
super important to work out things with the current priest, form a
temple trust, and manage other such things and to time all of it
perfectly.  This part of the plan is left as an exercise for the
reader.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, this is a much more fruitful exercise than setting
up a restaurant, since this helps a whole economy grow around the
temple.  A whole bunch of things crop up, near our small town.
Transportation grows by leaps and bounds, hospitals and schools
grow with the population, the local vendors start earning more and
get a better quality of life, and all that jazz.  I guess, you get
the drift.

It's just a co-incidence that this post is coming on
Independence day.
</p>

<p>
Last night I was in an auto with a couple of friends, and the
auto couldn't get up a slope and stopped near the edge of the
slope which was leading onto a main road. We had to get down
from the auto, and after a lot of fight, the auto got on top.
As the driver was trying hard to get the auto moving, a guy
comes over and starts talking to him in Marathi. I'm not sure
if he was a traffic police. He was dressed in white, but
didn't really look like one.
</p>

<p>
After asking a few questions, but not getting any replies, the
guy asks him in Hindi, if he understands Marathi, and on
getting a negative reply, starts shouting on him!
</p>

<p>
The guy harasses the driver, asking him to handover his
license and threatens him of horrible consequences, if he
doesn't do so. We tried to intervene saying, we want to leave
early and stuff, but the auto refused to start. The driver
asked us to leave and said he'll take care of the matter.
</p>

<p>
And then, today I hear people talking of national integration
and stuff. I hear stuff about changing the country, getting
rid of corrupt politicians and all the high ideals crap. I
keep hearing all sorts of patriotic songs that I hear only
twice a year. Not once more than that.
</p>

<p>
Why is it that we talk of all this only on these two days of
National importance? Why are these songs played only twice a
year? Don't we get that feeling of patriotism on other days?
Isn't patriotism a "true" feeling?
</p>

<p>
I think, India will only take a leap in it's progress, when
that happens.

This post is my attempt to start a travelogue. I hope to capture
the "All India Tour" phase of my life (as people have started to
call it).  I'll try to keep these posts from becoming travel
guides. There are loads of them and I surely don't need to
increment count.
</p>

<p>
This post is after a trip to Kanpur, Agra and Sikri.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Trains are never on Time. The delay increases exponentially with
your distance from the sourthern most tip of the country. Also,
the confidence of the aam admi in this delay is proportional to
the distance. Any delay less than an hour wasn't considered to
be a delay. Thanks to the fog, low visibility.
</li>
<li>If you want to travel around India, all you need is an
SLR. Additionally, if you are not of Indian origin, you'll need
the "India" guide. I got bored of seeing people poring over the
pages of that "blue" India book or madly clicking away on their
SLRs.
</li>
<li>Whether or not you get food or water on a train, you are assured
of enough "chilled" air from the slit under your window. Come
what may, you shall not be deprived of this service.
</li>
<li>The trust of a person in you is inversely proportional to the
difference between your ages. It is inversely proportional to
the 2.718th power of the difference if you are aged between 20
and 25. I only vaguely remember what the TTE told me in my
sleep, while paying the fine for not carrying a print out of our
e-ticket; but, it really was something sick and senseless.
</li>
<li>The chill at a place, on the day you reach, is inversely
proportional to how much people have scared/warned you. On the
rest of the days, it is proportional to the square of the warm
clothing you have on you. I thoroughly enjoyed the chill of
Kanpur. Wonderful! The infrastructure, too good! Never expected
a 50 year old campus to be so Awesome. [They have an air-strip
too!]
</li>
<li>The thrill of having an ice-cream is proportional to the square
of difference between the ambient temperature and the standard
room temperature.
</li>
<li>Don't ever think of celebrating your escape, without the Aalu
encounter. Welcome to the land of Alu addicted men. You shall,
surely, have your share. If not anything else, you shall be
serverd a Capsicum or Brinjal stuffed with Aalu. Also, the
quality and availability of leather seems to be proportional to
the addiction to Aalu.
</li>
<li>"hawker time" - the time you spend being followed by hawkers
trying to convince you to buy whatever they
have. "firang-ness" - difficult to predict; a parameter that
depends on the amount of branded stuff on you, stylishness of
your winter wear and other unknown variableness. Your hawker
time is proportional to (firang-ness) \* abs(time of day in 24
hr clock - 1400) [when, 900 &lt; time &lt; 1800] I understand, that,
they need to make ends meet; each day of their lives. I got
followed a lot. I can't help observing. Sometimes, enjoyed being
followed too.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Taj. Simply Awe-Inspiring. As Madhu put it, "the longer you
keep watching it, the more it's beauty overwhelms you". But, I
still think, the first time is the best time to see it. It's
simply mind blowing when you get the first glimpse, after entering
from the West gate.
</p>

<p>
It's time to stop writing when all you can see is proportionality
between totally unrelated things.  Here are a few pics

[yes, I know just three of the eighteen… and no foreign ones.. ]
</p>

<p>
Every year, during this time of the year, the papers and news and
blogs and all other such media, are filled with analyses,
comments, opinions and all sorts of things on the progress made
(and not made) by Independent India…. the flavour of patriotism
that was only subtle all this while, tends to grow upon us as the
Day arrives and I'm no exception.
</p>

<p>
Being an average Indian, just one amongst the Billion, the
progress (or non-) is a very big issue for me to comment on and I
would leave that job for the better qualified or the more
courageous ones. But I wonder, I (just) wonder…..
</p>

<p>
Come August and its the beginning of a new semester, bringing
along "Elections" in campus. This time is no different… I can
see people gearing up…. campaigning has begun even before the
announcement of elections or nominations… and what goes on here?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Dude.. I don't need to campaign.. there's enough guys from our state in our hostel.. so contesting= winning.. don't worry!"
</li>
<li>"Look dude.. both of us are from the same state.. so I know you will be obviously voting for me.. but still if you want, you can have a look at my Agenda… "
</li>
<li>"Hey, its not important for me to tell you my agenda… its sufficient for you to know that my opponent hails from the other half of the country (North-South)where we hail from..
</li>
<li>"People.. we need to make sure that only one person, belonging to our state contests for this post… or the votes will get divided"
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Where are those ideals of unity and brotherhood? Isn't it
important that the best person be chosen? Shouldn't the abilities
of a candidate be considered rather than where (s)he hails from or
what tongue (s)he speaks? Isn't it an irony, that all this happens
precisely during this time, when the whole nation is celebrating
the birth of an Independent India?? Shouldn't at least the
celebrations be able to evoke the emotions of brotherhood, love
and equality amongst us?? Shouldn't the fact that all of us are
here with a purpose, a common goal of education, enough to get
over the differences of language and origin? Shouldn't the
interests of the College and the Students overpower such minor
issues??
