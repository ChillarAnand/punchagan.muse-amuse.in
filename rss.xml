That dense book you want to read but has been lying on your desk while you
procrastinate on twitter. You know you'll have to tune everything else out,
and read slowly, word by word, trying to understand and make sense.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That vague blog post idea swirling in your head while you look at cat pictures,
one after another. Distilling your thoughts and putting them down for general
consumption is a lot of thinking and effort away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That &lt;code&gt;${cool_programming_thing}&lt;/code&gt; that a talk got you excited about so long ago.
But, watching talks and intending to start using it is all you do about it. You
know its going to take a fair amount of reading, thinking and time, before you
can really use it well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Like all those squats and lifts you dread, these things are building your
muscle. The thing about building muscle – it needs effort and feels like so
much hard work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can't build muscles effortlessly. Go do those effortful things! Only if you
care about those muscles, anyway.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blab</category><category>blag</category><category>learning</category><category>life</category><guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/effortful-things.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2016 10:13:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Better styling bookmarklet</title><link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/better-styling-bookmarklet.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
Some sites that I like a lot for their content, have zero styling on them.
I find it pretty hard to read when the lines are long and I have to read all
the way on my screen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had a simple bookmarklet until now that just changed the width of the page.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementsByTagName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'body'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'style'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'width: 600px'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kamalx"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; shared with me &lt;a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com"&gt;a recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for 7 simple styling rules that will make
pages easier to read. I liked them, and modified my bookmarklet to use these
rules now.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/images/better-websites.gif" alt="better-websites.gif"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Drag and drop the link below onto your bookmarks bar if you want to use it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style="border: 0.05em dashed; padding: 0.5em;" href="javascript:void(function()%7Bstyle%20=%20document.createElement(%22style%22);%20document.head.appendChild(style);%20style.sheet.insertRule(%22body%7B%20margin:40px%20auto;%20max-width:650px;%20line-height:1.6;%20font-size:18px;%20color:#444;%20padding:0%2010px;%20%7D%22);%20style.sheet.insertRule(%22h1,h2,h3%7B%20line-height:1.2%20%7D%22)%7D())"&gt;Better website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The code in a readable format is below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Create new stylesheet&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Create the &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; tag&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"style"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Add the &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; element to the page&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Add rules from bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sheet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;insertRule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"body{ margin:40px auto; max-width:650px; line-height:1.6; font-size:18px; color:#444; padding:0 10px; }"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;insertRule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"h1,h2,h3{ line-height:1.2 }"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;})();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Update &lt;span class="timestamp-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;[2016-06-07]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/baali_"&gt;baali&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to Firefox's &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages"&gt;Reader View&lt;/a&gt; which works well too.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blag</category><category>hack</category><category>web</category><guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/better-styling-bookmarklet.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2016 09:09:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Reading-time based scheduling</title><link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/reading-time-based-scheduling.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I had posted a link to an poem written on Medium on a Slack channel that I use
with friends.  A friend said that she liked the fact that the Slack article
preview had the reading time from Medium in it.  She could decide whether or
not she wanted to read the poem or any other article at that moment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This gave me the idea for a reading time extension for my &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium"&gt;browser&lt;/a&gt;, or my &lt;a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed"&gt;feed
reader&lt;/a&gt; or my &lt;a href="https://pinboard.in"&gt;bookmarks&lt;/a&gt; – my reading list.  The first version should be able to
compute or extract the reading time for an article or a tab in my browser, and
index them.  I want to be able to specify the amount of time I will be able to
spend reading, and be presented with something from my reading list.  I think
this would help with scheduling the reading of longer articles, and also to
actually help me get through my reading list.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Reading time estimates that use heuristics based on word-count may not really
work, and may do &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@fchimero/this-should-only-take-a-minute-or-four-probably-e38bb7bf2adf#.mvkd09m6m"&gt;more harm than good&lt;/a&gt;.  But, it may still be worth a try to see
if it helps my reading habits in any way.  A quick search pointed me to &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readism-article-reading-t/bmiolhceebkeljaikojgcoeefblcihje"&gt;this
extension&lt;/a&gt;, that can give the reading time for any page but doesn't really do
what I want.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blag</category><category>hack</category><category>idea</category><category>programming</category><category>reading</category><guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/reading-time-based-scheduling.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2016 07:43:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Stepping AFK</title><link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/stepping-afk.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
In the past few weeks, I noticed three instances where I was forced to take a
break exactly when I was ready to jump in and write some code to fix a bug or
add a small feature.  I had to step out of the house and take a walk to meet
someone, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I ended up getting ideas during the walks, which significantly changed and
simplified how I would've implemented things, if not for those breaks.  Even if
I did end up zeroing down to those solutions, I am pretty sure it would've
taken a couple of not-so-good attempts and much longer than it did.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Context switches are usually considered to be &lt;a href="http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/"&gt;expensive for programmers&lt;/a&gt;, but
taking a break at the exact time when I had all the required context loaded
into my head seemed to help. It was also probably helpful that I was taking a
walk, and there wasn't really any other inputs or outputs competing for the
space in my head.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This got me thinking about doing this more deliberately – I'd love to hear
about any experiences or any experiments any of you have done with this.  Also,
I'm reminded of Rich Hickey's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc"&gt;Hammock Driven Development&lt;/a&gt; talk and I wonder if
this is a smaller/different version of it, and makes me want to try out the
things he suggests more deliberately.  If any of you has thoughts and
suggestions, I'd love to hear from you!
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blab</category><category>blag</category><category>programming</category><category>thought</category><guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/stepping-afk.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2016 18:21:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>PyCon India 2016 - Propose a talk</title><link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/pycon-india-2016-propose-a-talk.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
CFP for PyCon 2016 is &lt;a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; and you should propose a talk!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There has been a lot of discussion on trying to improve the talk quality at the
events. As my bit of contribution to this, below is a re-hash of some good
advice from the internet on why you should give a talk, and how to submit a
good proposal.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/96692937#t=2m56s"&gt;needn't be an expert&lt;/a&gt; on a topic. If you have enough experience about
something to help make the next person's experience with it better, you are
good.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Its a great way to find people who are interested in the same things as you
are and to get to talk to them.  If you are an introvert, you should
&lt;a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/tech-talks-are-campfires-jesses-three-reasons-you-should-speak-at-pycon/#meet-specialists"&gt;definitely be speaking&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Proposing and giving a talk is about thinking about something hard enough to
refine your thoughts, and being able to explain it to others. Its a useful
skill to hone.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talks are &lt;a href="http://speaking.io/plan/talks-are-entertainment/"&gt;entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. Pick a topic that you are excited about and fascinated
by. Let it be a general topic that will have a significant number of people
interested in it.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What you want the attendees to be telling their friends about your talk,
after they go back.  Make it the &lt;a href="http://blog.briancurtin.com/posts/writing-a-pycon-proposal.html"&gt;objective&lt;/a&gt; of your talk.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Submit a complete, clear and compelling proposal. Show the reviewers that you
are willing to put in the effort to prepare for and to give a great
talk. Here are a &lt;a href="https://github.com/akaptur/pycon-proposals/tree/master/accepted"&gt;bunch of proposals&lt;/a&gt; to see and learn from.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Submit an outline along with your talk. Show the talk can be delivered in the
given time and will be interesting. Include an indication of how much &lt;a href="https://github.com/akaptur/pycon-proposals/blob/master/accepted/important_decisions_kaptur_2014.md#outline"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;
you intend to spend on each part of your talk.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Choose a good title.  The title is what catches the attention of your
audience when they are trying to pick a talk.  Avoid buzz words.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Get feedback. Like any writing, feedback can be helpful at all stages –
brainstorm while choosing topics to getting critique on the full abstract.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Convince the reviewers that you can give a &lt;a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/seven-tips-for-pycon/#note-to-the-organizers"&gt;well-rehearsed and entertaining&lt;/a&gt; –
link to previous talks you've given, include links to any testimonials you've
received from your audience, etc.  If you don't have a previously recorded
talk, give a small talk to your friends or colleagues and have it recorded.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyCon US has some &lt;a href="https://us.pycon.org/2016/speaking/talks/"&gt;good advice&lt;/a&gt; on how to submit a proposal and most of it is
generic enough for you to use for PyCon India, or any other conference.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;These posts (&lt;a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/tech-talks-are-campfires-jesses-three-reasons-you-should-speak-at-pycon/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/seven-tips-for-pycon/"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/tag/conference-tips/"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;) by Jesse Davis are so so good!
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I also liked &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/96692937"&gt;"The Talk on Talks"&lt;/a&gt; by Zach Holman.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The Ministry of Home Affairs put out a &lt;a href="http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/GeospatialBill_05052016_eve.pdf"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; and an RFC for a Geo-spatial bill
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To regulate the acquisition, dissemination, publication and distribution of
geospatial information of India which is likely to affect the security,
sovereignty and integrity of India.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even if you put aside questions about how a vetting process, for "dealing with"
any geospatial information, would help with the said goals, the bill defines
&lt;i&gt;geospatial information&lt;/i&gt; so broadly that even taking a geo-tagged picture at
the Taj mahal or sharing the location of your house for a meal delivery would
have you breaking the law.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A group of volunteers made &lt;a href="http://savethemap.in"&gt;Save the map&lt;/a&gt; which has more information on this,
along with a draft response that you can send to the Ministry.  Please respond
before June 2nd, 2016.

Earlier this month, a researcher made a dataset containing the profiles of about
70,000 users public. He didn't really see a problem in doing this because he
felt he was only presenting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KirkegaardEmil/status/730449904909324289"&gt;already publicly available&lt;/a&gt; data in a more usable
form. was only presenting it in a more usable form.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, I came across this quote in the very first chapter of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/allendowney"&gt;Allen Downey&lt;/a&gt;'s
book &lt;a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html"&gt;Think Stats&lt;/a&gt; which I liked a lot, and reminded me of this incident.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7193/26969166130_58e4865f47_b.jpg" alt="26969166130_58e4865f47_b.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I hadn't looked at the OKCupid data release and the discussion around it much,
but I went back and read &lt;a href="https://points.datasociety.net/okcupid-data-release-fiasco-ba0388348cd#.u8xxlkqsv"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by a social media researcher who thinks a
lot about these things. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
She puts forth a lot of interesting ideas to think about ethics. Some things
that stood out to me are:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself how the person whose data you are using feels about the data.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking a 'what if' impact approach to thinking about data and ethics.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also, you needn't really call yourself a researcher to be actually doing
experiments with (or &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/05/17/478266839/this-is-your-brain-on-uber"&gt;analyzing&lt;/a&gt;) "big-data" and discovering and putting out facts
that have an impact – however big or small. You should really go read the
article, whether or not you are a researcher using data.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Incidentally, there is a meet-up on &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/DataKind-Bangalore/events/231310093/"&gt;Data Ethics&lt;/a&gt; this weekend in Bangalore. I'm
excited to learn and think more about this, and talk to others who care.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blab</category><category>blag</category><category>data</category><category>ethics</category><category>programming</category><guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/thinking-about-data-ethics.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2016 15:36:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Level-up Tools</title><link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/level-up-tools.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
Thanks to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/baali_"&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; I got an upgrade to our still-being-setup kitchen.  I now
have a non-stick pan along with a few more new additions.  I would previously
use a bowl that people usually use to boil &lt;a href="http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/pot-pan/t/s/8/aluminium-polish-top-jk-vallabhdas-400x400-imae7w9y9ehukjhx.jpeg"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; etc. for making whatever I did.
The non-stick pan feels so great!  It has made it a lot simpler to make some of
the things I used to, because its non-stick. And it has vastly expanded the
possibilities of things I can make, by virtue of being flat and wide based.
The pan is such a great addition to my kitchen paraphernalia, and it adds a new
dimension to the kind of things I can make.  I'm not here to write a user
review for it, though.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What are such tools in other things that you do, that drastically changed the
way you did something, or added a new dimension to the kinds of things you
could do, tools that make you feel like you have a new super-power?  Learning
to write Python (after starting off with C) seemed to give me so much power
allowing me to focus on the problem, rather than fussing over the low level
details. Sasha mentions in &lt;a href="http://sasha.wtf/anki-post-1/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; how using a Spaced Repetition System like
&lt;a href="https://ankiweb.net/"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; drastically improved her efficiency because she could focus on thinking
about higher level things rather than trying to recall or search for what
method or function to use to do something.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What are some such level-up tools for you? Is there a systematic approach to
discovering tools?

Another post about blogging.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/CodeFalling/blog-admin"&gt;blog-admin&lt;/a&gt; now supports &lt;a href="http://getnikola.com"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to yours truly. &lt;code&gt;blog-admin&lt;/code&gt; is an Emacs
package by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/codefalling"&gt;CodeFalling&lt;/a&gt; that lets you view and manage your (static site
generated) blog from within inside Emacs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Nikola's command line utility is pretty nifty and does a bunch of useful
things. I had a few utility functions to do common tasks like create new post
and deploy blog. This worked well, but moment I came across this &lt;code&gt;blog-admin&lt;/code&gt;'s
tabular view, I was sold!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog"&gt;org2blog&lt;/a&gt; (a blogging tool I used previously) had a tracking file that kept
track of all the posts I made, and I used it quite a bit for navigation –
thanks to &lt;code&gt;org-mode&lt;/code&gt;'s search functionality. The tabular view of &lt;code&gt;blog-admin&lt;/code&gt;
is even better!  I really like the fact that the author has tried to keep the
package generic enough to support any blog, and adding support for Nikola has
been quite easy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The filtering functionality is crude, but good enough for a start. One thing I
want to add is a preview functionality for drafts. Showing some (writing)
statistics would also be nice – No. posts in the last month, total published
posts, etc.  No promises, but you may see some of these things, soon. :)

I use &lt;a href="http://getnikola.com"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; for generating this blog. When creating a new post, it prompts for
a title, and creates a file for the post.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Often I'm starting off with only a vague idea that needs to be fleshed out
before it can be published (or discarded). It is quite difficult to come up
with a title at this stage. I just want to start a draft and write things down!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I could use a "draft-title" and change it after finishing a post, but this
feels tedious – requires 3 steps – change the title, post filename and post
slug.  The last two steps are optional, really, but I feel they are important
especially when the original title is very different from the new one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Being forced to come up with a title before anything else, feels tedious and,
adds to the effort required to start off a new post.  I shouldn't really be
worrying about the effort required to change the title of an unwritten post,
but it happens subconsciously.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To work around this, I now have a "re-title utility" in my editor that takes
care of all the tedious details.  I can start with a random title, like
Draft-1, and change it when I'm done with the post.  I feel this is going to
lead to a lot more drafts, at the very least, if not published posts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another work-flow related thing I came across recently was @Malabarba's &lt;a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1717#issue-150907043"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;
on CIDER (an IDE for Clojure in Emacs).  The &lt;a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/getting-started/#Using_the_REPL"&gt;REPL&lt;/a&gt; takes a while to startup and
this caused him to not use CIDER for running tests, if there wasn't an already
open REPL.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The tedium that people feel effects how they use the tool.  Not surprisingly,
making tedious-feeling tasks a breeze with the tool also effects how and how
much they use it.  Subtle variations in a work-flow could make or break it.
How do you discover such potential work-flow make-or-break-ers? I think, these
things would help:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the tool yourself (dog-food)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to (or watch!) people using your tool
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at work-flows in other similar tools
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking explicitly about various scenarios and simplifying or improving
work-flows
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'd love to hear examples of this, and any ideas or thoughts you may have on
identifying and fixing such things!
