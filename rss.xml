&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started playing around with React.js to see how I could build the GitHub
organization dashboard, that I plan to.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got a horrendous idea of implementing a disqus-like commenting system using
GitHub's issue comments, and ran with it.  It seems technically feasible
based on some initial implementation.  I need to clean-up/rewrite the
prototype code on Monday.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-3"&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent the day with cousins at Central Park Zoo, Upper East Side River
front.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I finished going through the third of Dave Beazley's tutorials on Generators
and Co-routines.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also refactored api-diff to use astroid, instead of the ast module.  Kinda
happy with what I have, for now. May be more, later…
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><category>hackerschool</category><category>python</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/hacker-school-2014-08-20.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2014 02:43:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hacker School, 2014-08-21</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/hacker-school-2014-08-21.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added an additional view to xtab, to see all the pages that were killed,
and reopen them, if you so choose.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, cleaned up the &lt;code&gt;api-diff&lt;/code&gt; project and renamed it to &lt;a href="https://github.com/punchagan/what-changed"&gt;what-changed&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started thinking about building the GitHub organization dashboard, that I
thought would be interesting to have, since the 1st or 2nd week of Hacker
School.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bunch of awesome thursday presentations, and job fair and awesome food by
Chef Warren!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><category>hackerschool</category><category>jobs</category><category>python</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/hacker-school-2014-08-21.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2014 14:33:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hacker School, 2014-08-19</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/hacker-school-2014-08-19.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent most of the day working through David Beazly's tutorials on
generators and coroutines, and it was mind bending.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learnt about &lt;code&gt;send&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; methods on generators!  I hadn't heard of
them before, and was totally surprised to come across them.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent a little time late in the day getting class diffs working, and
refactoring the api-diff tool to remove duplication of code between classes
and modules. But, not very happy with the way I did it.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><category>hackerschool</category><category>python</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/hacker-school-2014-08-19.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2014 22:06:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hacker School, 2014-08-18</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/hacker-school-2014-08-18.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I refactored the API-diff code, and am pretty happy with what I have right
now, and need to add support for diffing Classes. I'm considering using
&lt;a href="http://www.astroid.org"&gt;Atstroid&lt;/a&gt; instead of Python's &lt;code&gt;ast&lt;/code&gt; module, since some of the work that I want
to do, has already been done for me.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the white-boarding group, we worked on a set of simple exercises for
strings and arrays.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;José Valim's presentation on Elixir was interesting and got me reading up a
stuff about concurrency, and related stuff.  Thanks!
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated my HS profile page with projects that I worked on, and a short bio.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joined the group discussing algorithmic complexity
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submitted a pull request to blaggregator to fix issues with broken profile
images.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/"&gt;Code is not literature&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The ideal presentation should be aimed at an audience of gentleman
and lady programmers—smart, and generally capable but without,
necessarily, any specific knowledge of the domain from which the
code comes. Presentations should provide enough context for the
audience to to understand what the code is and should explain any
details of the implementation language that may be obscure to the
average programmer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As reported in various places, there was an incident in early
November where commits in our Git repositories have become misplaced
temporarily by accident. By the mid next week we were able to
resurrect all the commits and things are back to normal now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As there are many confusions and misunderstandings in people’s
commentary, we wrote this post to clarify what exactly happened and
what we are doing to prevent this.

&lt;li&gt;I spent the morning cleaning up the "repr" functions of the diff classes, so
that the diff of functions between two modules can be printed out in a
somewhat meaningful way.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I spent most of the afternoon, preparing to make a small presentation on how
&lt;code&gt;sys.path&lt;/code&gt; works in Python.  I thought I didn't do as good a job of it, as I
would've liked, but Tom thought it was not too bad…
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Looks like another of those days, where I didn't get much done…  I spent
the evening finishing off &lt;a href="http://craphound.com/homeland/"&gt;Homeland&lt;/a&gt;. It's a brilliant book, and everyone who
cares about the Government and policies and technology MUST read it!  Thanks
Cory.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I feel like I didn't get much done yesterday.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I mostly worked on the API differ, but didn't get much done.  I have a few
tests, and some code for diffing two functions, but I'm not very happy with
it.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I helped Giorgio and Carlos with using my client only &lt;code&gt;hs_oauth&lt;/code&gt;
script/library, for their Zulip bot.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The white boarding group worked on some binary related problems, and it was
fun.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I looked at how the HS OAuth backend works on blaggregator and thought about
how to go about fixing the issue of broken images on the site.  The problem
happens because the image URLs are returned from the HS API calls, that are
made whenever a user logs in(?), and the URLs are cached.  Since, HS uses
cloudfront for its assets, the URLs expire after a period of time, and the
cached urls in blag's database need to be updated.  There could be two ways
of doing it -
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check if the URL 404s, every time a URL is requested, on the server side.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do it on the client side, with some javascript magic.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Intuitively, I feel like 2. would be better, but Madhu suggested
that 1. wouldn't be that bad either.  We could try both out, and see which
works better I suppose.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'd be interested to try this out, sometime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><category>hackerschool</category><category>python</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/hacker-school-2014-08-13.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2014 15:11:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hacker School, 2014-08-12</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/hacker-school-2014-08-12.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An issue I was seeing with &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; and a package installed in
&lt;code&gt;system-site-packages&lt;/code&gt; turned out to be non-reproducible.  It was probably
PEBKAC.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was wondering around in the morning trying to find something to work on.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I decided to work on Pankaj's idea to write a tool that gives you API
differences between two versions of a library.  It would be useful to have
the list of public API changes in a library you use, to estimate the cost of
updating to the newer version, without having to manually go through all the
changes.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent some time talking to Sophia, and looking at her FTP server's
refactored code.
&lt;/li&gt;
