I learnt to use Emacs' profiler yesterday, after many hours of yak-shaving,
trying to get &lt;a href="https://github.com/novoid/Memacs"&gt;Memacs&lt;/a&gt; working.  Memacs is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex"&gt;memory extension&lt;/a&gt; system for Emacs
written by Karl Voit, that I have been meaning to try out for a long time now.
Seeing lots of review posts at the turn of the year and watching Karl's recent
&lt;a href="http://emacslife.com/emacs-chats/chat-karl-voit.html"&gt;Emacs Chat with Sacha Chua&lt;/a&gt; pushed me to try and finally set it up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I started writing a &lt;a href="https://github.com/punchagan/Memacs/blob/chrome/memacs/chromium.py"&gt;module&lt;/a&gt; to create a Memacs file – an org archive file –
from my browser history.  It was pretty easy to write, and I had it spitting
out a huge file with 22k entries after about a couple of hours of work.  Then I
excitedly pulled up my agenda, and turned on the option to view archived
entries, only to be super-disappointed.  It turned out to be extremely slow!
Actually, the agenda never came up with the 22k entries file that I had. At
least not in 5 or so minutes, before I got impatient.  The performance was
unacceptable even when I reduced it to 5k entries.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was pretty sure it wasn't that slow for Karl in his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaKPr4J0K2I#t=999"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/punchagan/status/550723377871065088"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; to him,
asking for a workaround. Meanwhile, I looked at his dot-emacs, but wasn't able
to dig out what was needed to speed up things. He confirmed that his
performance was way better than what I was getting.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First, I ruled out the possibility of it being because of the SSD, since
clearly my CPU usage was peaking, and the task was CPU bound and not I/O.
Next, I tried using the same file on a different machine (with a different
version of Emacs and org-mode), and it worked blazingly fast.  So, it was
either the version of Emacs or org-mode that I was using.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I should have stopped, thought clearly, and started experimenting with org
version, but hindsight is 20-20.  I tried Ubuntu's pre-built Emacs and agendas
were fast!  I suspected my Emacs build, since I recently started building Emacs
from git.  I built two or three other versions of Emacs, and wasted a lot of
time, before realizing that I wasn't using the org-mode source bundled inside
Emacs for the tests, and there were two "independent" variables.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Finally, I began bisecting org-mode's source and found that all hell broke
loose with an &lt;a href="http://orgmode.org/w/?p=org-mode.git;a=commitdiff;h=b88c5464db2cb0d90d4f30e43b5e08d2b1c1fcea;hp=8cc4e09950594b2abec2502e9218318570595ac5"&gt;inconspicuous change&lt;/a&gt; around release 8.2.6.  It turns out that
org-overview was broken before this, and collapsing all the trees in a newly
opened org-buffer (default option) wasn't working. Once this bug was fixed,
opening huge org files would slow down by a great deal, in turn causing agenda
generation to be unbearably slow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All I had to do was add a &lt;code&gt;#+STARTUP: showeverything&lt;/code&gt; to the top of the file.
This speeded up things by about 50 times!  It turns out, I later found out,
that all of this is documented on &lt;a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html"&gt;Worg&lt;/a&gt;. I did try a few search engine queries,
but sadly none of them brought this up.  Adding the following to my config,
speeded up agenda generation by about 150-200 times!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;org-agenda-inhibit-startup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; ~50x speedup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; 3-4x speedup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the course of all this debugging, I learnt how to use Emacs' profiler.  The
profile reports along with git bisect, eventually helped me figure out what the
problem was.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To profile the CPU usage, all you have to do is add a call like
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;profiler-start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'cpu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; or M-x profiler-start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
at the place where you wish to start it.  Emacs will then start collecting
information about where time is being spent, by sampling every
&lt;code&gt;sampling-interval&lt;/code&gt; seconds (default 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; nanoseconds = 1 milli second).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can view the information being collected, at any point of time using
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;profiler-report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; or M-x profiler-report&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The report is a nice, interactive tree with the percentage of time spent in
each call. You can stop profiling by calling &lt;code&gt;(profiler-stop)&lt;/code&gt;.  If you have
more than one report, you can compare them by hitting &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; in one of the report
buffers.  I'm definitely going to use this for other things! (like speeding up
my startup?)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now that I have Memacs working with reasonably fast agenda views, I'm looking
forward to collecting as much personal information as I can!  Thanks Karl for
writing Memacs.  I am going to be a pretty heavy user, I think!  There seem to
be a few rough edges, though, and I hope to help smoothen them out a little
bit, over the next few weeks.

I've always wanted to be able to queue up messages to send to friends, until I
go online the next time.  I tried using email instead of chat a few times, or
just ended up staying online with a busy status.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Finally, now that I have started using jabber-mode for chatting from within
Emacs, I took out the time to write a "queuing system" for sending chat
messages, similar to the mail queue for smtpmail.  Instead of persisting sexps,
though, I persist the messages in a JSON format and the queue is flushed every
time I connect to jabber, in a &lt;code&gt;jabber-post-connect-hook&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To make the interface as similar to the interface available when I am online, I
hacked completion for the to ID using email addresses in my address book
(&lt;code&gt;mu4e~contact-list&lt;/code&gt;).  I really like the fact that the chat buffer opens up,
and I can type and send messages like I usually do.  Hitting &lt;code&gt;RET&lt;/code&gt; after typing
a message queues it up, instead of trying to send it. Smooth!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The code is in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/7a5e184146194b9e28fd7edbb94ddd6c3bde845e/user-lisp/setup-jabber.el#L35-93"&gt;.emacs&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>emacs</category><category>hack</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/jabber-message-queue.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2014 21:57:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Using tmux to "screen share"</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/using-tmux-to-screen-share.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I wanted to pair with a friend of mine, exploring Magit mode in Emacs.  There
are a couple of projects to make it easy to use tmux(-like) to simplify this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/non/pairing"&gt;pairing&lt;/a&gt; lets you share a screen and pair, on a common server where both the
users have access to.  But I wanted to use my machine, instead of the
server.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://tmate.io"&gt;tmate&lt;/a&gt; gets around the restriction of having a common server where both users
have access, but needs a custom install of tmux, and the use of a 3rd party
service.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I worked around this, using an ssh reverse tunnels.  Here are the steps, for
anyone who'd like to reproduce.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add your partner(-in-crime)'s ssh key to authorized keys on a server that
has a public IP (&lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;, let's say).
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Add your server's key to authorized keys on your local machine.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Create a reverse tunnel from your machine to the server.

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ssh -fNR 19999:localhost:22 server_user@example.com
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;-R 19999&lt;/code&gt; essentially forwards port 19999 on &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; to
localhost's 22.  &lt;code&gt;-fN&lt;/code&gt; is to say no terminal, send connection to background.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Your partner first ssh's to example.com and then ssh's to your laptop.

&lt;p&gt;
On your partner's machine
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ssh server_user@example.com
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the server, your partner does
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ssh your_username@localhost -p 19999
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Your partner is on your machine, and can run &lt;code&gt;rm -rf&lt;/code&gt;!  But, hopefully
they'll only run &lt;code&gt;tmux attach&lt;/code&gt;.  Obviously, do this only with people you
trust!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Start a tmux session locally.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Profit!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/using-tmux-to-screen-share.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 13:08:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>erc-notifications when Emacs not in focus</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/erc-notifications-when-emacs-not-in-focus.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I have been trying to get ERC working with notifications. Julien Danjou's
wonderful &lt;a href="https://julien.danjou.info/blog/2012/erc-notifications"&gt;notifications&lt;/a&gt; module for ERC is great, but it is annoying to get
notifications even when Emacs is in focus.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had looked at &lt;a href="https://github.com/eqyiel/circe-notifications/blob/master/circe-notifications.el"&gt;circe-notifications&lt;/a&gt;, which has the feature but uses xdotool and
xprop to do it.  I was looking for something simpler, though… and it suddenly
struck me that I have an auto-save hook in Emacs that is run when I focus out
of it.  I wondered if I could disable and enable notifications on focus, and it
worked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In case it is useful for somebody else -
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add-to-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'erc-modules&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'notifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;erc-notifications-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'focus-out-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'erc-notifications-enable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'focus-in-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'erc-notifications-disable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wonder if there are some corner cases where this doesn't work, and that's why
the author of circe-notifications chose the tools that he did.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>emacs</category><category>hack</category><guid>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/erc-notifications-when-emacs-not-in-focus.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2014 12:35:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>More input sources for org-drill</title><link>http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/more-input-sources-for-org-drill.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I've been trying to use &lt;code&gt;org-drill&lt;/code&gt; regularly for the last few weeks.  I don't
know how well it's been going but I have been sticking to the routine
religiously.  I haven't yet really tried out incremental reading, but in an
attempt to make it as easy as possible, I wanted to have a pdf-reader
integration, and some kind of integration with Kindle highlights.  Browser
integration is pretty straight-forward, thanks to some &lt;a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#sec-6"&gt;simple java-script&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I looked for a pdf-reader with some sort of plugin support, but I found nothing
in Evince or Okular.  I thought about &lt;code&gt;pdfjs&lt;/code&gt; but it seemed slightly clunky to
open pdfs in a browser, though I might shift to this if I don't like what I
finally ended up with.  Good old &lt;code&gt;xpdf&lt;/code&gt; seemed to be the only pdf reader that
had some support for custom keybindings that allowed users to run external
commands.  With a &lt;a href="https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/xpdf-capture"&gt;little Python&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to setup a work-flow to capture
snippets from &lt;code&gt;xpdf&lt;/code&gt;, to add to org-drill. Custom key-bindings somehow don't
seem to work on &lt;code&gt;xpdf&lt;/code&gt; bundled on Ubuntu. So, I ended up downloading and using
the binary available on the xpdf site.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For Kindle highlights support, with minor updates to Thamer Mahmoud's &lt;a href="https://github.com/punchagan/clip2org"&gt;clip2org&lt;/a&gt;,
I have a simple way of getting all the "new" clippings/highlights as org-drill
headlines.  I haven't really started using this, and once I do, I may end-up
automating even the merging of these items into the org-drill notes file.  I'm
looking forward to making better use of my Kindle, with this feature!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't know if it would be useful to have more context information like
section titles/chapter titles when capturing from html/pdf, but it seems like
an interesting problem to try to solve.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also, it might be easier(?) if I probably tried to have a DE level keybinding, and
some code to get selection and file name of the currently active
window/application.

I stumbled on a &lt;a href="http://rubyrogues.com/178-rr-book-club-refactoring-ruby-with-martin-fowler/"&gt;Ruby Rogues podcast&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, which had &lt;a href="http://martinfowlwer.com"&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt; as the
guest.  I really enjoyed the discussion on Refactoring (the noun, the verb and
the book!)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Martin clarified in the podcast that refactoring (the verb/process) is a
sequence of very small refactorings, while you keep making sure that you can
run the test suite always.  A refactoring (noun) is a change where you change
the structure of the code without any externally observable changes, with the
intent of making it easier to understand and cheaper to change in future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also really liked the metaphor of a 'healthy code base'.  Refactoring is,
then, the process of keeping healthy – exercise, speaking metaphorically.  You
can stack up all the exercise you need to do, until you get really unfit.
Refactoring, similarly, needs to be done regularly, to keep the code base
healthy.  This lets you go faster, in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also really liked the advise about trying to push back the mental contexts
you build, while trying to debug/understand some code that is not very clear,
by refactoring the code to make it clearer.  Code needn't be one big chunk of
cryptographic text.  Code is writing.  It should be clear and understandable.
Or, at least we should strive to make it so!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The discussion, as always on this podcast, was very lively, pleasant and
enjoyable! Enjoy!

I have been reading a bunch of articles on the SuperMemo site (including the
&lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol.htm"&gt;original thesis&lt;/a&gt; of P. A. Wozniack, the creator of SuperMemo).  I initially
started off trying to understand the algorithms SM2,5 and 8 which org-drill
implements, but reading the articles has given me a lot of general background
and theory on how memory works, and why SuperMemo is as effective as it is (for
those who stick with it).  This blog post is an attempt to summarize and
capture what I have read in all those &lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/contents.htm"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt;, and not get lost in them.  I
would recommend reading the thesis and the suggested reading there, yourself,
but if you really don't want to – this blog post + the summary in &lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm#Prioritize"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/decalog.htm#decalog"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; would be a good alternative.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory works by repetition.  Each time you recall a fact, the time it takes
for the memory to fade increases.  Spaced repetition is the idea of repeating
items, just when you are about to forget them – trying to optimize the time
spent on learning, as well as the retention of learned material.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Prioritization of the items we need to learn is key to being able to stick to
Spaced repetition.  Beginners tend to be over-enthusiastic about the
technique and fill up their system with stuff that they don't really care
about.  Applicability of the knowledge you are trying to gain, is a good test
for whether or not it goes into your system.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Each version of SuperMemo comes with a slightly modified (on most occassions,
improved!) algorithm.  SM2, SM5, … refer to these algorithms. Org-drill
currently supports only sm2,5 and 8.  It may be worth looking at sm15/16 and
seeing if it can be implemented and is worth doing.  In any case, using any
of these is &lt;b&gt;way&lt;/b&gt; better than not using Spaced repetition at all.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Understanding what we are trying to learn goes a long way in helping
memory. It is, therefore, good to start with basic material. People have been
surprised by how easily the advanced stuff fell into place, once they had the
basics covered.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Keep items in the system simple.  Stick to the minimum information
principle.  Keeping it simple, doesn't mean you leave out on learning the
complex stuff; instead break it into simpler components.  Simpler items has
the following advantages:

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple is easier to remember.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simpler items are easier to schedule.  You get more resolution to figure
out what the problem areas are.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple makes brings in redundancy automatically.  And &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redundancy_is_good"&gt;redundancy is good&lt;/a&gt;
    for memory, just like it is for managing hardware failure.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Keep learning fun!  Don't make review sessions a chore.  Think about the
material you are reviewing. Edit/delete/improve items based on your reviews,
then and there. Stay active.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It is useful to add a link to the source of the items added to your system,
considering that you wish to use the system over a long period of time
(ideally, the rest of your life!)
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Prioritize, add examples, appeal to your emotional state, link to existing
knowledge, use images. Anything else that works for you!  Use all of these
techniques, that work well and you probably already use in everyday life, in
the items you add to your system, to make them easier to recall.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Being physically fit and healthy is important for being so
mentally. Exercise, sleep, eat well, avoid caffeine.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;b&gt;See update &lt;a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/simple-org-clock-and-gnomepidgin-integration.html#sec-1"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have been trying to get back to using org-mode and its clocking
functionality, more often than not.  I used to use it a lot, a few years ago,
and haven't been using it, since I had been in my last job.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To help with it, I decided to integrate clocking in and out with changing
status on Pidgin, and turning notifications on and off in Gnome.  Here's a few
lines of code that does this for me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;defadvice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;org-clock-in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;pc/org-clock-in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;optional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;start-time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Turn gnome notifications off."&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;dbus-send-signal&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:session&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"org.gnome.SessionManager"&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"/org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence"&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"org.gnome.SessionManager.Presence"&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"SetStatus"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;shell-command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"purple-remote setstatus?status=unavailable"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;defadvice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;org-clock-out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;pc/org-clock-out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;optional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;switch-to-state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;fail-quietly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;at-time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Turn gnome notifications back on."&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;dbus-send-signal&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:session&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"org.gnome.SessionManager"&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"/org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence"&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"org.gnome.SessionManager.Presence"&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"SetStatus"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;shell-command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"purple-remote setstatus?status=available"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;Update &lt;span class="timestamp-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;&amp;lt;2014-11-01 Sat&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://baali.muse-amuse.in"&gt;@baali&lt;/a&gt; tried to use my code, and it turns out it didn't work for him, because I
forgot to mention that &lt;code&gt;(ad-activate 'org-clock-in)&lt;/code&gt; needs to be run, after the
&lt;code&gt;defadvice&lt;/code&gt; code.  I have no idea how it worked for me, without doing that.
May be because I have &lt;code&gt;defadvice&lt;/code&gt; for other functions?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also, while debugging this, I found that &lt;code&gt;defadvice&lt;/code&gt; is a deprecated way of
doing this, and &lt;code&gt;add-function&lt;/code&gt; is the way to go now.  But, instead of advising
the function, I decided to make use of &lt;code&gt;org-clock-in-hook&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here is the new code.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;pc/turn-off-notifications&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Turn gnome notifications off."&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;dbus-send-signal&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:session&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"org.gnome.SessionManager"&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"/org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence"&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"org.gnome.SessionManager.Presence"&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"SetStatus"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;shell-command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"purple-remote setstatus?status=unavailable"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;pc/turn-on-notifications&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Turn gnome notifications back on."&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;dbus-send-signal&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:session&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"org.gnome.SessionManager"&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"/org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence"&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"org.gnome.SessionManager.Presence"&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;"SetStatus"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;shell-command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"purple-remote setstatus?status=available"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'org-clock-in-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'pc/turn-off-notifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;add-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'org-clock-out-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'pc/turn-on-notifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I've &lt;a href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/notes-from-pycon.html"&gt;ranted before&lt;/a&gt; about PyCon not meeting my expectations, and I even skipped
going to the last PyCon.  Somehow, I hoped that it would be better this year,
but no such thing happened.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should strictly not attend any talks, at the next conference I am at.  Even
if the topic seems interesting, I should refrain from attending any talks,
unless I know that a speaker is entertaining.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I should be going there to meet old friends, meet a few new people, and
mostly hacking on my stuff.  May be aim to show something at the lightning
talks at the end of second day, based on what I did during the rest of the
event.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Participate more actively in open spaces, and may be initiate or suggest some
myself.  Sprints for bug fixing, adding new features to a project may be a
good way to get new developers to start contributing to FOSS projects.  It
would be even better to be in touch with folks before the event, and use this
opportunity to iron out kinks.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think the talks could be improved drastically. A lot&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/making-pycon-india-better-for-myself.html#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/making-pycon-india-better-for-myself.html#fn.2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has been said,
already.  Here's a summary of how I see it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beginner/Novice talks doesn't mean bad talks.  A talk with a good narrative,
that drives home a point, that may be familiar to most of the audience, would
still make a good talk.  I don't mind reading a good blog post/book on a
topic I already know, because there is joy in reading/listening to "good"
stuff.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Talks cannot be judged by titles or an abstract.  Taking inspiration from
PyCon US, we could

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for a video recording of a previous talk or a short home-made
recording of the speaker presenting some topic.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ask for a granular outline &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/making-pycon-india-better-for-myself.html#fn.3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; along with rough timing information, instead of
just an abstract.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Have a bunch of resources &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/making-pycon-india-better-for-myself.html#fn.4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/making-pycon-india-better-for-myself.html#fn.5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/making-pycon-india-better-for-myself.html#fn.6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; available for speakers to improve on their
proposals/accepted talks.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Have a bunch of 20 or 30 minute talks, and very few longer (45 min) talk
slots.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Encourage speakers to try connecting their laptops and iron out
"presentation" kinks on the day before their talks/lunch/other allotted
times. Technical issues like fonts being too small, mics not working,
adjusting the volume/other settings for the speaker, etc. can and should be
fixed before hand.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The talk review committee could also take notes from attending some of the
talks, and compare it against their notes when they accepted the talk, to
improve the talk selection process.  Some of it could be valuable feedback
for the speakers too.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Org-drill is an Org-mode extension that provides spaced-repetition and
flash-card functionality.  It has a &lt;a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html"&gt;wonderful documentation on Worg&lt;/a&gt;, but
somehow I couldn't get myself to read the whole document, and setup org-drill,
until now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The setup is quite straight forward, once you have org-mode along with the
&lt;code&gt;contrib&lt;/code&gt; packages.  Just &lt;code&gt;(require 'org-drill)&lt;/code&gt;, and you are all set!  To add
a new card, all you need to do is add a &lt;code&gt;:drill:&lt;/code&gt; tag to the items you wish to
"Org-drill".  You can start a review session with simply &lt;code&gt;M-x org-drill&lt;/code&gt;.  You
will be shown flash cards, and you can rate how correct and comfortable you
were, in answering the questions.  Based on your responses, the cards are
scheduled for review.  Start another review session, whenever you need one!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What I could only understand once I got myself to read the whole document was
that:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The default scope of a drill session is the current file.  But, you can start
sessions with scopes like current tree, current directory, or a specified
list of files. This is super-useful!
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The review sessions are not automatically scheduled, based on when you
schedule failed flash-cards.  Scheduling the review for a card only sets a
due-date for them, and effects, what you are asked in your next session.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Cram mode and incremental reading are also things I want to try, as I go along.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Happy Learning!
