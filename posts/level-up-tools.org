Thanks to a [[https://twitter.com/baali_][friend]] I got an upgrade to our still-being-setup kitchen.  I now
have a non-stick pan along with a few more new additions.  I would previously
use a bowl that people usually use to boil [[http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/pot-pan/t/s/8/aluminium-polish-top-jk-vallabhdas-400x400-imae7w9y9ehukjhx.jpeg][milk]] etc. for making whatever I did.
The non-stick pan feels so great!  It has made it a lot simpler to make some of
the things I used to, because its non-stick. And it has vastly expanded the
possibilities of things I can make, by virtue of being flat and wide based.
The pan is such a great addition to my kitchen paraphernalia, and it adds a new
dimension to the kind of things I can make.  I'm not here to write a user
review for it, though.

What are such tools in other things that you do, that drastically changed the
way you did something, or added a new dimension to the kinds of things you
could do, tools that make you feel like you have a new super-power?  Learning
to write Python (after starting off with C) seemed to give me so much power
allowing me to focus on the problem, rather than fussing over the low level
details. Sasha mentions in [[http://sasha.wtf/anki-post-1/][this post]] how using a Spaced Repetition System like
[[https://ankiweb.net/][Anki]] drastically improved her efficiency because she could focus on thinking
about higher level things rather than trying to recall or search for what
method or function to use to do something.

What are some such tools that would really transform my arsenal?  Is there a
systematic approach to discovering tools that could make such a huge impact on
what we are doing?
