- "Silence is the language of god. All else is poor translation." ~Rumi
  

- “To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart
    will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make
  sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not
  even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little
  luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or
  coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket — safe, dark,
  motionless, airless — it will change. It will not be broken; it will
  become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to
  tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only
  place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the
  dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.” -- /C. S. Lewis/

- Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care -- not just
    of any great method that descends from the heavens. That these acts
  are simple doesn't mean that they are simplistic; and it hardly
  means that they are easy. They are nonetheless the fabric of
  greatness and, more so, of beauty in any human endeavor. To ignore
  them is not yet to be fully human.  -- James O. Coplien, /Foreword
  to Clean Code/

- “We are all in the same boat, in a stormy sea, and we owe each other
    a terrible loyalty.” – G.K. Chesterton

- The road to wisdom? -- Well, it's plain and simple to express:
  
  Err
  and err
  and err again
  but less
  and less
  and less.

  -- Piet Hein (Grooks)
