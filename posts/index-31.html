“… no one is never really alone. Even when there is not other perso around, there still must be someone. Someone who made you  and therefore cares what happens to you.

Exam time now. Sleep time cut-down! [already compensated for,
during the whole semester! :D] Getting up quite early during these
days…. [To cram in something at the last minute.. :P]
</p>

<p>
But all that kept aside, I feel great to be waking up early in the
morning. Watching the Sun rise.. is a great feeling. The calm of
the dawn, the chirping of the birds n the cool breeze.. Its
absolutely amazing – awe inspiring. Its a great experience. A
rare one for me,though.. :( For the last four semesters, I have
been a part of the owl-tribe… staying awake till late in the
night and doing all sorts of stuff… [other than study - during
the non-exam time…] Its great fun staying awake very late in the
night… having fun with friends… B'day parties, Musical
sessions in Ringo's room, Movies, Carrom-Nights, all-night
Chats(online n offline..) and lots of other stuff.
</p>

<p>
But all this can be done during the day can't it[The fun of doing
it in the night is totally different though..]?? If I enjoy the
morning times so much, shouldn't I be enjoying it more often? If
its such a great feeling.. to be waking up in the morning.. should
I trade it with all the fun I have, late in the night?? Is it
worth it? Like Voodoo believes, should I put in efforts to enjoy
the sunrise each day??  Is it time.. that I try out the
cliche… "Early to Bed, Early to Rise…" [EBER – that's what UC
calls it… and hence the title… :P]
</p>

<hr>
<p>
<b>Update:</b> If for Fear, people are able to
cut-down so much on their sleep, and work so hard, I wonder how
much is possible for <b>LOVE</b>. I think this is the thing that drives
all the great achievers… the Scientists.. the Hackers.. the
Artists.. the Engineers… the Writers.. the Doctors.. and a lot
of others…  I need to find something, that I would Love to work
on.

    <p>
I was just wondering, a couple of nights ago, at dinner.. "When
did I first decide that I would be doing Engineering?" The answer
– I don't know…  All I know is that, during my High schooling I
was more interested in Maths and Science {Physics specially…}
Then I did what most just-out-of-school kids with an interest in
Math &amp;amp; Science do {specially in that part of the world where I
live, Andhra Pradesh} Took up Math.Phys.Chem in intermediate and
prepare for Engg. entrance tests alongside. After failing to get a
rank that would fetch me an <b>Engg. course</b> in any of the IITs, I
landed here..
</p>

<p>
Then the choice of discipline, that was just based on popular
opinion and luck [called preferential allotment…] and I finally
ended up in EEE.
</p>

<p>
But the question is when did I make that choice of becoming a
so-called Engineer? Did I ever consider the alternatives and make
a decision? If yes, then when?? What kind of an engineer did I
choose to become? Did I make the choice of becoming an electrical
engineer??
</p>

<p>
I think, I never knew what kind of an Engineer I wanted to be.[
with the knowledge of an average School pass out…, you wouldn't
expect one to know all about the various fields of Engineering.] I
think, I never even exactly knew [and don't do so now…], what it
means to be an Engineer. An <b>Electrical and Electronics Engineer</b>.
</p>

<p>
But isn't it important that we the future "Engineers" of the
Country, know what it means to be one and what is expected of us?
Isn't that knowledge essential, for taking a decision to do
engineering.. and also to make the most out of the Engineering
programme?
</p>

<p>
I wonder what field {or profession or whatever you call that…} I
would choose, if I were given a chance now… [i.e after a couple
of years in an Engineering College…]… I wonder which
discipline I would choose after getting this little insight into
the various fields in Engineering… I wonder what I would choose,
if I get this chance, a couple of years later… or five years
later… :D

<blockquote>
<p>
Engineering is a great profession. There is the fascination of
watching a figment of the imagination emerge through the aid of
science to a plan on paper. Then it moves to realization in stone
or metal or energy. Then it brings homes to men or women. Then it
elevates the standard of living and adds to the comforts of
life. This is the engineer's high privilege. – Herbert Hoover

        <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2007</span>
    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
This semester [2-2] I had to give two presentations! As if that
was not enough trouble, the courses were (Principles of)
Management [POM] and (Theory of) Relativity [ThoR] !! The former
was with a group and the latter was an individual affair.. Each
one had its Trials and Tribulations… But at the end of each, I
feel equally foolish. None of them were worth the efforts…
</p>

<p>
The POM (a course whose reason for existence most of us fail to
understand) presentation was specially torturous to our group. We
had 8 members in our group, but to no avail. Nobody, other than
Bubbly, was bothered about it until we were neck deep. With just 3
days left for the last day to submit the Report/Soft copy, our
frantic searches began. We finally landed on an interesting topic,
A Case Study on AMUL… We started work only on the night before
the submission day… But the interest and excitement, [along with
deadline.. :P] got us through with amazing speed. All of us, were
through with our parts of the job before going to bed. The next
morning, I along with 9 put together everything, almost ready to
be submitted. But fate had other plans for us… The topic we
worked on was rejected! Reason:There's already a group working on
it!!
</p>

<p>
Back to square one… we began the search again. After much effort
we found a couple of topics and approached her for
approval. Though the topics weren't damn interesting.. they were
something we would've liked to work on. But all we get is another
rejection and a Magazine that had a ready-made case study! We were
supposed to speak on operations management[o.m] in a cosmetic
multinational! [2 days, to work on some *#&amp;amp;$# cosmetic firm!
Worasht!! Imagine writing a Report on a Presentation on a Report
in a Journal… and that too on a Cosmetic Company!!] The last
nail on the coffin was hit. We felt hopeless and work didn't start
again till the night before the D-Day.. Not interested in working
on that cosmetic thingy.. we decided to work on o.m in some other
firm, and HLL seemed a neat choice.
</p>

<p>
After slogging through the whole of the next morning, we somehow
managed to get the report ready and finally at 2 pm, me and 9 went
in search of a printer! None was found until 5:30 in the evening!!
Somehow we submitted it finally… Phew!
</p>

<p>
But that's not the end of the story. There was a lot more in store
for us. The presentation date. We were given a date, on which to
give the presentation, but couldn't give it on that day, for too
many people were called and there was too little time… Hats off
to our Ma'am for such wonderful managerial skills. We had to beg
her to allow us to present it on a date convenient to all of
us.[She insisted that we do it on a particular date, when we
already had other appointments!?!!] Finally, she agreed. Phew!
</p>

<p>
On the D-day, 8 people, 40 mins… it was fun! There wasn't enough
time left for my turn and so I hurried through my part, the
conclusion…. But,the best part of it all was that, even a
half-hearted, just-for-the-sake-of-it effort could impress her!!
The presentation passsed off as a "very good presentation"! [Not
"yaxcellent!", though]
</p>

<p>
Then the Relativity one! I had to speak on Kerr Black
Holes. I hadn't heard of them until one day Dr. A.K. Biswas gave
me the topic, and asked me to speak on it, after he finishes
teaching Schwarzchild Black Holes. It was all fine, until there
was just a week left for the Compre's to start and he didn't start
teaching about Black Holes!! This Monday he asked me when I was
going to give my talk. Hoping that he would teach at least a small
part of it during the last week, I chose Friday. [Even at the cost
of ruining my comprees..] But, he didn't even tell us what Black
holes were, leave alone discussing the Schild Black Hole. I was
trying my bit to work my way through it but 3 days were too few to
read all about static Black Holes and then move on to Rotating
ones! I had a tough time.. but tried my best to make head and tail
of it. Finally today, I thought I understood a decent part of it
and was ready to present it before the class.
</p>

<p>
After an unsteady and slow start, I managed to put across a few
points about Black Holes in general and the Kerr Geometry.  But
then, I wasn't very comfortable with the other parts of what I had
to present, and this clearly reflected in my talk. It was growing
dumber and dumber… So, Sir stopped and asked me if I was going
to present the Penrose Diagram, and I said no. Thankfully he
understood my situation and asked me what I wanted to present and
asked me to finish it off with a few of the simpler things. I
jabbered something and was done with it. Phew!
</p>

<p>
But what was the result of all this drama? Were the results
in proportion to the efforts put in? Were the presentations really
worth the effort?  If the intention of these presentations was to
increase the Knowledge base of the class, I think we achieved
nothing. If we were supposed to enlighten the class, then we
failed in a big big way. But if the intention was to increase our
own knowledge base, I would say we succeeded in a very small
way… There definitely are much more efficient ways to increase
our own knowledge base. So is there any other purpose for such
talks??
</p>

<p>
A final few things… [I know you are wondering why I wrote this
post. Such a long one. I don't know….]
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It would've been better had the topic change been in ThoR and
not in POM. I should have spoken on Black Holes in general and
Schwarzchild Black Holes. Not Kerr Black Holes.
</li>
<li>The two people who guided us/me in the Presentations had
contrasting opinion on the Internet! Our Ma'am considered the
Internet to be a Devil [or some such thing] She doesn't like
the fact that people get info for their presentations from the
net. [Why? we haven't figured out yet] Journals are god-like
for her!! Unlike her, our Dr.Biswas is quite respectful of
this wonderful tool.. the Internet.
</li>
<li>None of these presentations were comparable [in terms of
energy,excitement and fun we had!] to our last sem's
presentation, "Copyleft". Is it because Copyleft wasn't a
course related topic?? :P
</li>
<li>Giving a Technical presentation is tough. Its even worse if
you are speaking on topic that you are studying just for the
sake of the presentation.
</li>
<li>The presentations were rated as good, even if I know they were
no where close to what a Real Presentation should be like. POM
– bcos Ma'am thought we used the journal she gave us!! ThoR
– to encourage us to put in greater efforts.
</li>
<li>I'm not very good at giving presentations…

A few days back.. we [the usual gang of Ringo,9,UC,Vudum n
me.. along with a lot of others who joined us later] were in the
park, just relaxing and having a chat… but with the others
joining us [with whom I usually don't hang around..] , the topics
discussed were quite different from those that interest me…and
we usually talk on..  I was getting bored.. but suddenly an
interesting idea popped up… the funda of living on CS.. [though
the tone in which they looked at the idea was different… I found
it interesting..]
</p>

<p>
The ppl were criticizing a guy (don't wanna name him :P) {who
hosted wierd maps with soccer and other such stuff in it..}.. the
people were imagining wild things like.. maps in which class-notes
would be read out/scrolled… maps where food items would be
displayed at lunch time.. etc.. This might look like a funny and
weird idea.. (that gave us all a nice laugh..) but it doesn't seem
ridiculous or crazy to me.. the very fact that the idea was
conceived, annihilates it ridiculousness, for me. Though such a
degree of dependence (and addiction??) may be an over exaggeration
but…
</p>

<p>
A walk in the hostel corridors any time during the night will tell
you why i say this… I can see people in every room… (literally
every one.. and mind you I am no exception to this..) stuck to
their comps doing all sorts of things… [actually not a wide
range.. its pretty predictable… :-(] and now after my comp's
network card got burnt out (…probably… thanks to the lack of
grounding in hostels) I can see it even more clearly… that
computers are ruling our lives… [at this point.. I'm confused
why I started writing this… what's it that's bugging me? I'm
definitely not against ppl using Comps.. for I love them…]
</p>

<p>
Is it that it pains me to see people use comps for stuff that's
not so technical? Does it hurt me that we have such "Powerful"
machines before us.. and all we do with them is trivial things
like chat with others or play? I don't think so… Yes, when I
read the book Hackers:Heroes of the Computer Revolution, I felt
ashamed of using my comp in a meek and powerless way… but then I
realise that they were the Hackers from the Hacker land .. and
everyone can't be one, can they? Then what's it, that bugs me?
</p>

<p>
I guess I miss the time we spent in the first (and a little of
second) semester… when very few people had comps. We had a great
time… doing other activities that were more physical… and
refreshing (than sitting in front of a comp and posting
this!!).. I miss those football tourneys we had in the
quadrangles.. I miss those "leg" cricket matches… I long for
something like the Wrestling match we [Vudum, Ravi,Thatha n me]
had in my room… I miss those thermo sessions with Vudum n
Ravi.. I miss the tuts in Ravi's room… (mind you we sometimes
studied even when there weren't exams!!) I guess I miss a lotta
things from the first sem… The time at dinner and the chats in
parks, are the only things that are still intact… [ I wouldn't
dare forget to mention our recent trip to the woods near the
lake… it was awesome!! something that we'll all cherish for
life…] I just hope we have more and more and such
moments… moments that i will cherish for life… moments.. that
"we" will cherish for life…
</p>

<p>
<b>Update</b>: I just saw Ringo's old cd of Illayaraja songs… and
 realised, I forgot to mention the wonderful time we
 [Ringo,9,Hari,UC n me..] had listening to them in Ringo's room on
 a CD player… and Ringo's mouthorgan!!!

PS stands for Practice School…
</p>

<p>
I would've titled this post, "NPL… here I come!!" but for all
this…
</p>

<p>
It all began with an unannounced letter from the PS
division… giving us just 5 days time to fill up our "PS-1"
forms… with Waves round the corner.. this was too short a
notice.. and the panic button was pressed.. and pressed real
hard!! {lots of heated discussion.. frantic google
searches.. repeated calls to/from home.. etc were kicked off…}
</p>

<p>
Then, the filling up of on-line forms… [oh you thought.. online
forms were a cakewalk?? even i thought so.. until this!!] We had
to fill a priority list of 214 items.. flat… That was not the
big problem… We had a not so well developed form handler…[i'm
probably being unfair to the developers…because the server also
caused quite a few problems… but that's the least i can say…]
I know of people.. who learnt their options by-heart… thanks to
the wonderful system and the server, that made them fill the whole
list 4 to 5 times..
</p>

<p>
Then there was this headache of filling up everything in
ink… [one of the rare ocassions.. other than reports for MT n
Mu-P… when i wrote so much.. and felt it all useless…]
</p>

<p>
Then, a meeting organised by seniors to "help" us choose
PS[Practice School] stations… noble intentions.. but i ended up
being more confused!! [After telling all the good stuff.. they
came down to the point that staying close to home.. is the best
thing to do.. this put me in soup!]
</p>

<p>
All this is nothing when compared to the "declaration of results"
(it wasn't any exam.. to call the allotment.. results.. but the
use of these words is intentional…)  First, there was an April
fool attempt by one of the students… it was quite cleverly
planned but the little error of sending everyone the same
password.. ended the whole thing tamely.. but it dindn't go for
nothing.. it was successful in rebuilding the stage… people
began discussing the topic..
</p>

<p>
After a wait of 4 days… the D-day finally arrived… and people
went crazy!! As if the excitement wasn't enough.. the PSD added
its bit.. the results weren't sent to everyone at once.. they sent
it one by one, discipline-wise… (god only knows how they managed
the feat[around 1400 students!!], manually) People were eagerly
waiting for the results… a world cup final would have been no
match… F5 keys on all the keyboards took a beating… People
shouting wildly!! (both in delight and rage..).. There was quite a
lot of Drama…
</p>

<p>
Now after the reality has sunk in… its a bit cooler… but still
quite humid.. every talk inevitably is leading just to this… a
lot of analysis, discussions and post-mortem going on…. happy
about their partners/collegues… people getting angry with
others(both for discussing and not discussing about
it..)… unhappy with partners… phew! a lot of action all around
the place… [It's as if a sleeping Giant has just been woken
up…]
</p>

<p>
After all this hype and ballyhoo.. i just hope the PS stands up to
something… I mean.. I hope I stand up to it…. and do
something.. some small bit of work.. that'll keep me hooked for a
couple of months.. something that'll be worth thinking of later on
in life… something that'll be worth posting abt…:-P
ok!…. "NPL… Here I come…!!"

A couple of days back.. one guy called green<sub>mamba</sub> asked me.. "Why
do you use Linux (GNU/Linux) and not Windows? What is it that
makes LinuxGNU/Linux] so special for you?" I avoided that
question then.. {I was in no mood of answering questions… Exams
had finished just the day before!!}  I am trying to answer it
now… green<sub>mamba</sub> also told me that Roopesh said, "I use it
because I can look at the source code. I am allowed to look at how
things work and fiddle with the way they work!"… I knew it
immediately that this was not the reason for me.[I rarely looked
at source code… and making changes to it.. haha..] So what is
it? I think I can answer this question if I get back to the time
when I started using Linux…[hehe.. not too long ago!! :P]
</p>

<p>
So how did I start using GNU/Linux? How did "we" first meet? It
was during last summer holidays.. that Voods sent me this link
… [I had definitely used GNU/Linux on a few occasions
before… but.. this was when I really began using it…] and
within hours I was a fan of GNU/Linux!![and Richard M Stallman
(RMS)]
</p>

<p>
So its the "philosophy"… The philosophy of Free
Software… [Free as in Freedom, not as in Free Beer…(English is
a wierd wierd Language…)]… The philosophy of Open
Source… that brought me to it… This song says it the best…

<p>
now I continue to use it.. for a variety of reasons..[they are NOT
in the order of their priority/importance]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Firstly, using Linux gives me a sense of community… a sense of
oneness [this can't happen with Windows.. because you can't
share stuff… :-(]
</li>
<li>I have begun to hate the concept of Proprietary Software… can
you believe that.. "Sharing stuff..  makes us PIRATES!!"
</li>

<li>I am a growing fan of the Command Line… It simply rocks!!
</li>

<li>There's almost no problem of Viruses/Malware.. You simply don't
need an Anti-Virus..(that needs to be updated every night.. or
u'll have nightmares…)
</li>

<li>Then there's this wonderful concept of Live-CDs.. {specially
Knoppix.. Its absolutely awesome!} It put me(us?) out of
soup… a lotta times…
</li>

<li>The fiddle factor… I have just started to fiddle with
things(…source codes… I added a small feature to my
dc-client Microdc2].. the feature of away messages.. it feels
gr8! :P)
</li>

<li>One of my best friend is using it too! [you know who…]
</li>

<li>The Mascot looks cool!! ;) [I liked the GNU mascot too! (It's on
my side-bar) ]
</li>

<li>The name "LINUX"!! [There's so many flavors(Distros) of
Linux.. that I can keep trying different ones.. all my
life :P.. presently with Slackware!]
</li>

<li>Its Fun!! and I want to use it…
</li>

<li>and finally… Windows sucks! [I don't have to use it… :P]!!
</li>
</ul>

Value your freedom or you will lose it, teaches history. "Don't
bother us with politics," respond those who don't want to learn.

When you say, "I wrote a program that crashed Windows", people
just stare at you blankly and say, "Hey, I got those with the
system, for free".  –Linus Torvalds
</p>

<p>
"What happens when you read some doc and either it doesn't answer
 your question or is demonstrably wrong? In Linux, you say "Linux
 sucks" and go read the code. In Windows/Oracle/etc you say
 "Windows sucks" and start banging your head against the wall."

There's a post already with 'exactly' this name…. by 9… here…
But this post doesn't have much to do with his post… [or may be it does??]
</p>

<p>
Here's a Quote on Mahatma Gandhi…
/Generations to come, it may be, will scarcely believe that such a
one, as this, ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. –
Albert Einstein/
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering…. what would happen if the name Albert
Einstein was replaced by punchagan… and it turned out
that.. there's a huge huge list of candidates for replacing
Mahatma Gandhi… [This is with due respect to the Mahatma and
Einstein.. I don't, in any sense, intend to say that the Mahatma
was not a Mahatma…]
</p>

<p>
All I want to say is… I am seeing a whole lot of new things, in
people around me, that inspire awe and respect in me… that every
person is unique… every person is special.. every person can
teach you something…. there's something to learn from
everyperson… that makes me believe God,truly, created man in his
own image…
</p>

<p>
I am grateful to all the people around me (and those not around
any more..)… who have shown, are showing, and will be showing me
things bright and beautiful… wise and wonderful… which
otherwise I would have failed to see..
</p>

<p>
I am grateful… for getting me back on track.. when i go
directionless,.. for setting me examples to emulate,… for being
with me whenever i needed and will need you…
</p>

<p>
[ I would've loved to write down each and every name here…. but
that's too big a job for this little being to achieve… ]
</p>


<p>
As William Arthur Ward says….
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
and not giving it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To All Jaani's of the World… Thanks a Lot… (I know that's too
small a word… but that's all I can give right now…)

loyal, through whom you are blessed, and for whom you are

In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is
then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We
should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner
spirit.  – Albert Schweitzer
