  MARSSx86 (MARSS for short) is a tool for cycle accurate full system
  simulation of the x86-64 architecture, specifically multicore
  implementations. Our goal is to create a simple yet efficient full
  system architectural simulation environment based on existing tools.

  Open source is about the people involved. Code can be replaced,
  re-written, even removed completely, and the project will continue
  to move forward. The open source community is made up of people who
  have dedicated their time and their life to see its success.

  A friend of mine recommends reading 3 calculus books to learn
  calculus. I generalize it to reading from 3 sources to learn
  anything. I also postulate a law: the 3rd source you read is the
  best.
