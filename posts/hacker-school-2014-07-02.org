- I pushed the code onto [[https://github.com/punchagan/cinspect][github]] to let Allison and Tom review it, and Tom was
  quite excited by the idea of having it.
- I added a startup script in IPython, to monkey-patch it to use my code for
  introspection.
- Having never written a C-extension, I read up the Python docs on [[https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html][writing C
  extensions]], and played around a little with [[https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/][pycparser]], but it didn't seem to
  work too well with the Python's sources.
- I later went to the New York Public Library to see [[http://www.nypl.org/press/press-release/2013/06/26/new-york-public-library-display-historic-copies-declaration-independe][a copy of the Declaration
  of Independence in Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s hand.]]
