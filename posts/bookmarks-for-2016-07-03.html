It is our duty to spend our time working to surrender, dismantle, and destroy

learned because that is what counts the most. You put in many hours to read
books, make sure you get something out of it.

These are the books I refer to often — some books are timeless and get better
as you study them. There’s a real difference between reading a book for the
first time, and reading it for the second time. And so forth.
 Here are 5
books that I reread every year. And every year, they become better and more
useful to me.

Not every company has to claim to solve problems that change the world. As is
clear from recent examples in the media, vision at the expense of truth can
have huge repercussions for both consumers and investors alike. Not only this,
but the lack of humility and the sprinkle of spin distracts us from what’s
really important. Humanity’s grandest challenges.

Who you are is defined by the values you are willing to struggle for. People
who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who get in good shape. People who
enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who
move up it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainty of the starving
artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.

A while back I wrote about why I work hard. I mentioned that my mentor taught
me to rest before I get tired.
 Weirdly enough, resting can be a different
thing; especially if you want to achieve your goals. But it’s also
necessary. Rest and work go hand in hand.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
One of the concepts central to systems thinking is the idea of levers and
leverage points.
 In any given system at any given time, certain activities at
certain times provide more leverage than at others.
 So I started thinking
about different mental models of leverage points that I’ve found both in my own
experience and through reading.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/">Creating a Latticework of Mental Models: An Introduction</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The truth is that the good ideas are just as dangerous as the bad ones. Warren
Buffett’s mentor, Ben Graham, used to put it as such:
 
 You can get in way
more trouble with a good idea than a bad idea, because you forget that the good
idea has limits.
 
 The best antidote to this sort of overreaching is to add
more colors to your mental palette; to expand your repertoire of ideas, make
them vivid and available, and watch your mind grow.
 
 You’ll know you’re on
to something when the ideas start to compete with one another. At first, this
is mildly uncomfortable. One idea says X and the other idea says the reverse of
X: How do I decide which is right?
 
 This process of letting the models
compete and fight for superiority and greater fundamentalness is
called thinking! It’s a little like learning to walk or ride a bike; at first
you can’t believe all that you’re supposed to do at once, but eventually you
wonder how you ever got along without it. As Charlie likes to say, going back
to any other method would feel like cutting off your hands.

I mean, just look at how much society celebrates Fridays and hates Mondays, but
shouldn’t it be the other way around?
 Imagine we would all love what we do so
much, we would be all sad every Friday because it would take us away from
something we love doing.

In an alternate reality most people have a 'grain' implanted behind their ear
that records everything they do, see or hear. This allows memories to be played
back either in front of the person's eyes or on a screen, a process known as a
're-do'.

They could set a better example by asking “why” and “what if” — while asking
others to do likewise. And as the questions proliferate, some good answers are
likely to follow.

<p>
Ah, romantic love; beautiful and intoxicating, heart-breaking and
soul-crushing… often all at the same time! If romantic love has a purpose,
neither science nor psychology has discovered it yet – but over the course of
history, some of our most respected philosophers have put forward some
intriguing theories. Skye C. Cleary outlines five of these philosophical
perspectives on why we love.
 
 Love authentically. Lovers support each

In the year 2016, we continue to believe that the best approach to a child's
curiosities about sex and more, is suppression. Here's a newsflash: it doesn't
work. All we end up doing by telling girls that honour resides in their bodies
is that we cause them shame when they are molested or raped. Dishonour should
be attributed to the person who commits such terrible acts, and not the
victim.
