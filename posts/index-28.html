    <p>
Lost in thought, in the maddening crowd waiting for the next train
on a Sunday evening, I was staring blankly, looking at nothing in
particular. I had come to see-off UC, Sunil and 9.
</p>

<p>
A man carrying a stretcher on his head, suddenly comes into my
focus and I have an impulse to look down. But, I manage to look at
people who are closer to the guy, and see looks of pity, shock and
disgust. Most of them looked down, sooner than later. It was not
long before the man, was right next to me and I could see an
injured man lying on the stretcher with a stream of blood oozing
out of his head. All I could manage was another expression of
pity, shock and disgust. I didn't want to act as if I had seen
nothing. I didn't want to stay as if I could do nothing about
it. I didn't want to look down. But, that's all I ended up
doing. The man carrying the stretcher was not exactly struggling,
but I'm sure he would've more than liked some help. Not one
amongst us moved.
</p>

<p>
Around half a minute later, I see a constable walking calmly
(maybe with a shade of concern in his stride) in that
direction. The next train was there in less than a minute and 9
got into it. I was feeling absolute disgust at my reaction. In the
hope of making some amends, I walked in the direction that the
stretcher guy took. Soon I found them. I didn't have to
search. There was an audience of onlookers, watching the stretcher
carrying guy inspect the other guy. He was waiting near the
entrance of the station and I'm guessing he had called for some
medical help and was waiting for it to arrive. The policeman and a
couple of others were standing next to him, while he was
inspecting the injuries. Everybody else was watching — from the
stairs, from the over bridge, the platform, the
tracks. Everywhere. Being a part of that crowd was the last thing
I wanted to do. I walked away.
</p>

<p>
PS: I (infact, we - uc, sunil, 9 and me) have had my own tryst
with the Mumbai local. Keep your head on your shoulders, while you
are anywhere near them. They are not the trains in your local
fair.

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2009</span>
    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
Well, this could be called a post after ages, considering that
most of previous posts have just been 'news reports'. I have been
wanting to make a post since long, but I probably lost it. I
really am unable to write anything that I find worth posting [It
does raise questions about the existence of this blog. I'm writing
this, to answer that question to myself.]
</p>

<p>
This post is provoked by an act of sharing, an act of kindness, an
act of goodness, that surprised me. This post isn't about the act
itself, but it's about me being surprised. Why on earth should I
(or anybody) be surprised, when someone is just being human?
Aren't human beings meant to be and feel human?
</p>

<p>
I wonder why people say, "this is a bad, bad world." I find a lot
of goodness and humanness around me. Unless I strain my memory
really hard, I can only recall people who try to be as good and
nice as they can be; People trying to be as human as
possible. Either there's something utterly wrong with my judgment
of people or there's something wrong with the general feeling that
the world is a bad, bad place.
</p>

<p>
There's one other possibility that just strikes me - I am so nice
to people that, everyone else tries to be nice with me. I don't
think I am such a big deviation from the average. I'm just another
goat, in the great herd.
</p>

<p>
And another one, I'm in a really special place, presently. I have
been only to the special places. I have visited only the places
that are at an extreme, far away from the 'average' place in the
world. But, given I'm just another goat in the great herd, this is
very unlikely. I am probably grazing at a random spot on the great
grasslands.
</p>

<p>
Since these are ruled out, it boils down to either a wrong
judgment or a wrong general feeling.
</p>

<p>
Coming to my judgment, I wouldn't call myself an Oracle or the
wise one, but I'm no dumb ass either. Well, taking the statistical
route, the number of times I've had any real "nasty" surprises in
dealing with people has been much lesser than the number of times
things turned out nearly as expected. My judgment could,
therefore, possibly given some credibility.
</p>

<p>
So, that leaves me with just one possibility. The idea that the
world is a bad, bad place is not entirely true, if not completely
absurd and outright wrong. The world is really a nice place, with
"human" beings inhabiting it. The nasty surprises that you get,
really are the surprises and not the general rule.

        <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2009</span>
    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
Well, there are a hazaar tutorials on setting up Postfix and
Mailman for Debian for a single domain. There were a few for doing
that for multiple domains also, but nothing comprehensive, if I
could say so. This link is pretty comprehensive and details all
the steps for setting up Postfix for a single domain.  Here is all
you'll want to know about setting up Virtual domains in Postfix.
</p>

<p>
You only need to make a few changes for adding a second (or more)
domain. You just need to add the <code>virtual_alias_domains</code> and add
<code>virtual_alias_maps</code>. Here is a glimpse of how my <code>main.cf</code> looks:
</p>

<pre class="example">
myhostname = mail.abc.in
mydomain = abc.in
mydestination = $myhostname, $mydomain, localhost.$mydomain
myorigin = /etc/mailname
virtual_alias_maps =
                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-xyz,
                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-abc,
                hash:/var/lib/mailman/data/virtual-mailman
virtual_alias_domains = xyz.in, mail.xyz.in
</pre>

<p>
<code>virtual-xyz</code> and <code>virtual-abc</code> contain the virtual aliases for
each domain. Note that Postfix expects hash files and hence you
need to run <code>postmap /etc/postfix/virtual-abc</code> each
time the file is changed, to keep the hash file in sync with the
text file that you edit. Also, you need to run <code>postfix reload</code>,
each time you make changes to <code>main.cf</code> or <code>master.cf</code>
</p>

<p>
Fairly straight forward, right? But it took me quite sometime to
get it all right, since this was the first time I was doing
anything with Mail Transfer Agents or the like.
</p>

<p>
Now, onto Mailman. Well the Installation Manual of Mailman,
literally has it all. Here is a look at how my
<code>mm_cfg.py</code> looks:
</p>

<pre class="example">
DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST = 'abc.in'
DEFAULT_URL_HOST   = 'mail.abc.in'
add_virtualhost(DEFAULT_URL_HOST, DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST)
POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS=['xyz.in']
add_virtualhost('mail.xyz.in', 'xyz.in')
MTA='Postfix'
</pre>

<p>
The only trouble was to get mailing lists with same names on both
the domains (which I couldn't get working). I experimented with
multiple mailman instances but that won't work because the MTA
can't differentiate between the two instances of mailman. The
alternative is probably to have two instances of postfix running
too. But that I felt was like going too far, and gave up. [What if
we wanted to add another domain to the list?!]
</p>

<p>
Also, I had to make a few alterations to the Apache file to allow
access to the mailman pages without breaking the Zope redirection
that was already set-up.
</p>

<p>
[Thanks to Shantanu and Vattam (and all the hazaar people using
Postfix and Mailman and cared to document things for the sake of
others, and of course Google)]

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2009</span>
    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
I had the opportunity to attend a FOSS talk session organized by
Center for Distance Education Engineering Programme (CDEEP) as a
part of the National Mission on Education through ICT. The
National Mission on Education through ICT has some lofty goals,
which when reached will take the country ahead by leaps and
bounds.
</p>

<p>
The Mission has a budget of $1billion in the 11th Five year plan,
40% of which will be spent on content generation (all of which
will be free/open source) and the rest will be spent on making
available a minimum bandwidth of 1Gbps to the 30,000 odd colleges
spread over India (out of which around 3000 are Engineering
colleges). The mission has various projects planned and they are
picking up steam rapidly. The project I will be working on, for
the Adoption of Open Source in Engineering and Science Education
in India, is also a part of this Mission. Prof. Kannan had kick
started the session with an introduction to the National Mission
on Education through ICT. The talks were all being webcast to
various EduSAT centers and on the web.
</p>

<p>
Then, Prof. Pathak talked on, why open source is important. He
said, (not exactly quoting him) " It is theoritically possible for
any person to learn and discover things from scratch, but there's
been only one Ekalavya in the entire history of India." Education
is a social activity and hence open access to content is
absolutely vital. He mentioned various things like how IIT-B has
been working on Creative Commons licensing and other things going
on here. He ended the talk with a hope that soon India will move
from being a net taker of Open source to a net giver to open
source.
</p>

<p>
This was followed by three talks, delivered by developers from
RedHat meant for programmers who wish to contribute to FLOSS.
</p>

<p>
The first talk was by Ramakrishna Reddy, titled 10 things a FLOSS
developer should know. It was a pretty nice and balanced talk,
covering a wide range of things. I would like to point out a few
things, that I liked the most.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He clarified the term hacker as soon as he used it.
</li>
<li>He emphasized a lot on groking code; reading code for fun,
looking at the code of others, reading as much code as
possible…
</li>
<li>He talked of muscle memory of emacsen. I liked the way he talked
of people being so quick with their editors and how learning to
use your tools effectively is a big plus
</li>
<li>Release often, Release early. Everybody talks of it, but he said
a few words, which I liked. Some developers don't usually
release their code as early for the fear of being ridiculed. But
don't bother, "we are just small people, in the whole galaxy."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The next talk was by Prasad Pandit on How to use Infrastructure
for FOSS projects. Prasad talked of Website, Version Control,
Mailing list, IRC, Bugzilla, Wiki and RSS feeds. He gave quite a
few examples on how each thing is important, most of the examples
being his personal experiences.
</p>

<p>
The last talk was by Rahul Sundaram and was on Communication in a
FOSS project. For a change he didn't have slides and the reason
for that, he said, is that communication in a FOSS project is
casual and not having slides and walking in with a t-shirt and
jeans represents that casualness which is a culture of FOSS
projects' communication.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be polite, but don't be Formal.
</li>
<li>Be precise, but do provide a context to what you are saying.
</li>
<li>Don't fear that you'll say something foolish, which, will be
archived for eternity. Mistakes are there to learn from. Not
just you, but others too.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
He talked of quite a lot of things, but these were the things
which struck me as particularly interesting/important.
</p>

<p>
At the end, all the participants walked out with Fedora 11 DVDs
from the RedHat/Fedora guys. :D

replaced the html pages that were being used on the PS site.]

<li>So often, little things get blown out of proportion, so
quickly. Or its just that not everybody sees them as 'little'
things.

<li>On slow connections, the download 'handler' of firefox does
really poorly. It's next to impossible to download anything over
half an MB.

<li>This from the preface of SICP<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="/posts/arbit-blab.html#fn.2">2</a></sup> ,a text book for an
introductory course on Computer Programming at MIT
<blockquote>
<p>
Our design of this introductory computer-science subject
reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the
idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a
computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel
formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus,
programs must be written for people to read, and only
incidentally for machines to execute. Second, we believe that
the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this
level is not the syntax of particular programming-language
constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular
functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of
algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the
techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of
large software systems.
</p>

<p>
I would like to see a few courses developed on similar lines here.
</p>
</li>
<li>Gmail themes are good. I only tried the "Terminal" theme,
though. I loved it!
</li>
<li>For the very first time, I upgraded a distro. I successfully
moved to Intrepid from Hardy. (and that too with the campus
net!) This was before the repositories had been set-up. Now, it
should be a much simpler job to achieve the same

<li>Just got the news of more Violence in Mumbai; What the hell do
these people want? I end this post here.

Yes, I've turned 21 today. I'd like to write a post today, but
this song (by Adam Sandler?) more or less conveys, how I feel.

I'd just like to thank everyone, who prays for me to grow up and

<b>The Happy Birthday Song</b><br><br>
Once a year we celebrate<br>
With stupid hats and plastic plates<br>
The fact that you were able to make<br>
Another trip around the sun<br><br>
And the whole clan gathers round<br>
And gifts and laughter do abound<br>
And we let out a joyful sound<br>
And sing that stupid song<br><br>
Happy birthday!<br>
Now you're one year older!<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
Your life still isn't over!<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
You did not accomplish much<br>
But you didn't die this year<br>
I guess that's good enough<br><br>
So let's drink to your fading health<br>
And hope you don't remind yourself<br>
The chance of finding fame and wealth<br>
Decrease with every year<br><br>
Does it feel like you're doing laps<br>
And eating food and taking naps<br>
And hoping that someday perhaps<br>
Your life will hold some cheer<br><br>
Happy birthday!<br>
What have you done that matters?<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
You're starting to get fatter<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
It's downhill from now on<br>
Try not to remind yourself<br>
Your best years are all gone<br><br>
If cryogenics were all free<br>
Then you could live like Walt Disney<br>
And live for all eternity<br>
Inside a block of ice<br><br>
But instead your time is set<br>
This is the only life you get<br>
And though it hasn't ended yet<br>
Sometimes you wish it might<br><br>
Happy birthday!<br>
You wish you had more money<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
Your life's so sad it's funny<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
How much more can you take?<br>
But your friends are hungry<br>
So just cut the stupid cake<br><br>
Happy birthday!<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
Happy birthday, dear…<br></p>

<b>Notice for the Internet Usage</b>
</p>

<p>
Internet Facility is provided to students for academic activities
and e-mails. It is observed that few students are misusing the
Internet facility by using excessive internet bandwidth for
non-academic purposes. The students who are running the hubs are
strictly informed to close their hubs. Computer Center will be
starting official hub for the sharing of academic information and
open source softwares.
</p>

<p>
If a student is found while doing so the network facility will be
blocked by Computer Center for a semester. Further, a student will
be called by a disciplinary committee and a severe disciplinary
action will be taken.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This Notice from the Computer Center is creating waves all
around. This isn't the first time, though, that the people
in-charge of the Network have "acted".
</p>

<p>
Academic activities; wonder what it's definition is, in their
dictionaries. It surely includes the following.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using Internet for 'academic activities' or emails, during
class-room hours makes no sense.
</li>
<li>Anything 'academic' cannot have a size greater than 5 MB.
</li>
<li>Accessing version control systems ( svn, cvs et al ) cannot be
classified 'academic'
</li>
<li>IRC cannot teach you anything. Don't ever dream of thinking it
as 'academic' to hang out on \\#python or \\#emacs
</li>
<li>All 'academic' stuff is limited to the http(s) ports. You
wouldn't need to use any other ports, ever.
</li>
<li>Any 'academic' activity fits within a span of 2 hours or can be
done in blocks of 2 hours each, with gaps of 2 hours in between.
</li>
<li>'Academic' stuff doesn't definitely contain key-words chosen by
the "all-knowing" admins.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Moreover, the people in-charge who refused to allow the use of a
computer in the CC as a server for on-campus repositories of
GNU/Linux packages, now wish to host a 'hub' for sharing
open-source softwares! There's already an official ftp server
which hosts the academic info and a few useful softwares. I don't
see how a hub would be different.
</p>

<p>
We don't have any disciplinary committees for people smoking in
hostel rooms, causing a lot of trouble for others around them, but
we are going to have them for hosting hubs. ( Well, a new law
banning smoking in public places in India has been passed just a
few days ago. Hopefully it'll work better than the older one,
since now there's some pressure on the people in-charge of the
public place. )
</p>

<p>
Also, it could be argued that college isn't meant only for
'academic' learning and a lots of other learning takes place here
(and the hubs were definitely helping quite a bit) but I'll leave
that for another day, probably. Also, I don't think 18+ year olds,
people who are about to step into various big roles, leading the
country need to be told how to make use of the
facilities/resources available to them; A degree of freedom is
indispensable, I believe.
</p>

<p>
I appreciate the efforts being made to improve the network
situation here and also help the students get the most (
'academically' ) out of their college experience, but I feel the
situation deserves more careful handling.
