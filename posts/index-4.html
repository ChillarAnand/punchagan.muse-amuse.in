not using <code>realloc</code> correctly.

<li>NYC's library also had an interesting exhibhition on the history of
America, just before and during WW-I.

<li>On Sunday, I tried out Mary TTS on the raspberry pi, and it is simply
unusable.
</li>
<li>I then, started writing a simple wrapper around Google's tts that is used
by Google translate.
</li>
<li>The TTS part is more or less working right now, the next step would be to
deploy it on the RaspberryPi and start using it as a radio, to see what my
needs are like. Hooking it up to <a href="https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client">Jasper client</a> seems like a good idea,
right now… though I'm not sure if it would work very well, with the pi's
audio output drowning out the voice commands.

formatting exploits.  It acted as more than a gentle refresher for C, and was
super fun!

<li>I spent some time with Tom, while he tried to get <code>cinspect</code> working for him,
and it seemed like having the developer next to you, helped.  As always.  We
didn't make any fixes to the code, but it worked.
