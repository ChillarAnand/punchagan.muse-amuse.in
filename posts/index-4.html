Well, as you can see, I've changed my blog a bit.  I had been
trying to make it gel well with org-mode and looking for ways to
allow me to share arbit stuff with separate feeds for tags,
separate pages with independent feeds, etc.
</p>

<p>
I finally got around to tweaking the code of reprise to be able to
do this.  There are still a few things I would like to change, but
I'll make the changes gradually.  The looks are also straight from
uddigal's reprise, with a few tiny tweaks.  I hope it is alright
to be using it.  I really liked the theme.
</p>

<p>
Every tag now has a separate feed. <code>/tags/emacs.atom</code> will give
you the feed of <code>emacs</code> for instance. Also, I plan to have a
couple of more pages, one for all the interesting links I come
across and another for interesting quotes.  Both of these pages,
have their own feeds too (<code>quotes.atom</code> and <code>links.atom</code>).
</p>

<p>
In the spirit of minimalism, I got rid of comments.  I've been
looking for ways of having comments without all the javascript
cruft from disqus, but I didn't find any satisfactory way to do
this.  So, the site will have no comments.  You can write to me,
in case you've something to say to me.
</p>

<p>
Adios.

Another post on <code>org2blog</code>.  Yes, the project is still alive. ;)
Well, frankly quite a few people seem to be using it, and I
regularly get bug-reports and feature requests.  I'm happy. :)
</p>

<p>
Actually, this post is to announce a change in the namespace of
<b>my</b> org2blog.  It turns out that there is another package that is
called org2blog, but it posts to blogger.  Tehom, the author of
the other package got in touch with me, and we tried to clean up a
few things.  In this process, we decided to use two different
namespaces, to avoid conflicts if a particular user has both the
packages loaded.  I am going to use <code>org2blog/wp</code> as my namespace
prefix, instead of the older <code>org2blog</code>.  So, if you are posting a
sub-tree, you'll need to use the <code>org2blog/wp-post-subtree</code>
function, instead of <code>org2blog-post-subtree</code>.
</p>

<p>
We, Tehom and I, did discuss the possibility of merging the two
packages into a single huge package, but we think the amount of
work is far greater than the payoffs.  So, the packages continue
to be called <code>org2blog</code> but we reference each others packages, to
reduce the confusion, amongst users.
</p>

<p>
<code>org2blog/wp</code> version 0.4 comes with the new namespace.

Org-mode, as a mode, is obviously awesome.  The ability to move
around whole blocks of text, for re-organizing documents and the
usability of tables are just two brilliant features.
</p>

<p>
But, the org markup itself is such a cool thing.  I've been
looking at <code>rst</code> all day, and it's such a pain to find out where
your headings are, what level your current sub-heading is at, etc.
(I'll probably do a bit better, with some getting used to. I'm an
org-addict. ;)).  With org-mode it's so intuitive!  It's so easy
to find out, with just one quick look!  I don't think any other
markup has this coolness! Org-mode FTW!

I gave a short talk titled, <i>Pictures, Songs and Python</i> in this
year's edition of SciPy India.  The talk was a beginner level
talk, mainly intended to get newbies excited about Python.  My
motive was to impress upon the audience that Python is a language
to help you think in. It's a good playing ground to experiment
with your ideas, quickly prototype ideas and have fun!  To my
surprise, the talk was liked by quite a few people.  Thanks to
Prof. Jayant Kirtane for the Bournville!

A note to self, but may benefit someone facing a similar problem.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <b>Problem</b> </dt>
<dd>SSH-ing to our server was working well.  But, file
transfers like <code>scp</code>, <code>git push</code> were failing.
</dd>

<dt> <b>Diagnosis</b> </dt>
<dd>I had been thinking it was a problem with our
campus network on the first night and was too
sleepy to try and fix it.  But things didn't
improve even after one full day.  Then I asked a
friend of mine, and he confirmed that he has been
facing the same problem for a couple of days.  I
then tried file transfers to another server and
it was working fine.  Then I tried file transfers
between the two servers and even that worked fine!
</dd>

<dt> <b>Solution</b> </dt>
<dd>After some googling, I figured that the problem
was with a machine between me and the server.
Changing the <code>mtu</code> to 1492 from 1500 on the
server, fixed the problem. :)

Pandoc is a haskell library and a command line tool, that can
convert markup from one to another and it does it pretty well.
Until now it supported quite a few markups, but not orgmode.  But
now, Orgmode support has been added! Yay!
</p>

<p>
But, it can only read from other formats and write to org-mode
format.  The other way around, is not possible, but you can do
that straight from org-mode, right?
</p>

<p>
I've often felt the need for an org-importer and hence decided to
do something about it.  I stumbled upon Pandoc, when I was moving
my blog, and found it pretty neat.  After, yet another request for
an importer, on the org-mode mailing list, I decided to look at
Pandoc.  I was somehow under the impression that it was written in
Python.  But it turned out, I had to learn Haskell!  A good excuse
to learn a new language, eh?  I brushed through a tutorial for a
couple of days (and was blown off by the paradigm of the language)
and was able to port the RST writer in Pandoc, to an Org
writer.  :)

This is some fun I had, trying to replicate what was written in
this post. I had been trying to understand what was happening
here, and found this post on Hacker News very helpful.
</p>

<p>
It is a known fact that our eyes have more cones for green and
red as compared to blue.  The Bayer filter used for digital camera
lenses is based upon this principle.  This post tries to
illustrate that using the following two arguments.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Looking at only the blue channel of an image looks very dark.
</li>
<li>Tripling the pixel size of blue channel doesn't cause much
distortion in the final image.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hence, our eyes suck at blue.
</p>

<p>
Their argument is flawed, but we could try and improve a few
things.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Looking at the blue channel.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This is definitely flawed, since the intensity of blue in the
image they have taken may be less and hence giving us a false
positive.
</p>

<p>
We could instead gray-scale the image and use these pixel values
in the 3 channels and look at the images.
</p>

<p>
This also eliminates the problem of the image being captured
through a Bayer filter.
</p>

<p>
Here's some <code>python</code> code to do the same. (uses <code>matplotlib</code>)
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">show_channels</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">I</span><span class="p">):</span>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Pixelating the blue channel</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Again, there was this argument of use of Bayer filter affecting
the image and the like.
</p>

<p>
What I did was to swap the channels, and then look at the
images. However I swapped the channels, the image where the
green channel was pixelated always looked the worst.  The
difference between blue and red was less noticeable, I feel.
</p>

I posted a snippet <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/raise-windows-on-current-desktop-xdotool-bash.html#fn.1">1</a></sup> of python code that used xdotool to
raise windows.  I got one patch from dusual <sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="/posts/raise-windows-on-current-desktop-xdotool-bash.html#fn.2">2</a></sup> that
enabled raising of windows in the current workspace only.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Jordan gave a one-liner <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/raise-windows-on-current-desktop-xdotool-bash.html#fn.3">3</a></sup> in bash,
that could do the same thing as my long and elaborate python
snippet.  I had a feeling that this would be much shorter in bash,
but I don't feel comfortable writing bash scripts. :P
</p>

<p>
Below is a bash snippet that tries to incorporates both the
changes. :)

<p>
<b>Note</b>: When you've visual effects enabled (the default option on
Ubuntu), getting the current desktop/workspace doesn't work,
probably because Root Window properties are being messed around by
it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note2</b>: <code>search</code> takes an option <code>--screen</code>. It'd be nice if it
 also had an option <code>--desktop</code>.  This task could then be done in
 a one-liner.
