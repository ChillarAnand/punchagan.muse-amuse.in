I just wanted to thank Sacha Chua for bearing with my newbie elisp
code and trying out org2blog.

Also, thanks for the two patches she sent.
  1. Feature addition - Posting sub-trees instead of whole buffers.
   I had this feature in mind, and had started working on it after
   her request, but she was too quick for me! ;)
  2. Cleaning up of the code that uploads images.

I'm loving it!
