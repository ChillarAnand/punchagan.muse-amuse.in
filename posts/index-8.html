<li>I worked for the whole day on implementing <i>an algorithm</i> to analyze a
cipher text, and guess the substitution cipher used.  The algorithm
was pretty straight forward, and I had it "mostly" working, in a
couple of hours.
</li>
<li>I then began to refactor it, and found that there was what looked
like a bug, and I "fixed" it mindlessly.  I was essentially trying
to swap 2 rows, and columns of a pandas data frame.  I had a
data-frame <code>D</code> and its copy <code>D_</code>.  I was trying to swap 2 rows and
columns of <code>D_</code>.  I found that the code was initially using the data
from <code>D</code> to do the swap.  To fix it, I checked if tuple unpacking
did the right thing.  It looked like it did.  So, I used something
like <code>_D['a'], D_['b'] = D_['b'], D_['a']</code>.  Essentially, changed <code>D</code>
on the right hand side to <code>D_</code>.  I thought I had tested this on the
terminal, but after hours of debugging (along with fixing another
minor issue), I later found out that the tuple unpacking doesn't
work and the swapped rows and columns actually become equal!  I had
suspected this initially, and had "tested" this manually, I
thought.  These are the kinds of things that should have tests for,
I think.  It wouldn't have taken me too long to write a test, and I
could have been totally sure that it works!  (I was manually reading
off values in the array, and probably messed up somewhere)

<p>
FWIW, the code now reads <code>_D['a'], D_['b'] = D_['b'].copy(),
  D_['a'].copy()</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>The algo seems to need about 1000 characters to get past the 90%
accuracy mark.  I could probably tweak it a little to perform
better, but I'm going to leave it here, for now, and move on to the
signal processing parts.  I'm not totally sure how the signal
processing would work, and whether we could actually map back the
keystrokes to a substitution cipher enciphered text.
</li>
<li>If required, the tweaks could be -
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use trigrams instead of bigrams
</li>
<li>Add a degree of dictionary look-ups: May be something like,
look-up all the deciphered words, and try not swapping the
characters that appear in most of the words that are in the
dictionary.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This paper is 20 years old, and there would surely be work by others
building on top of this, or doing it totally differently.

<li>The Apprenticeship patterns book is very interesting!  I shall
continue to read it and start create daily/weekly rituals from the
actions prescribed in the book!
</li>
<li>I was reading <a href="http://blogs.collab.net/git/protect-git-history#.U6fixh-caV4">this post</a> on <code>git gc</code>, <code>reflog</code>, etc. and wanted to
see what the default values were for some of the configurable
variables.  But, the git config command didn't help.  Developer/code
defaults are also a part of the "config" system, and any tools to
inspect config variables should display them, if no other values
have been set explicitly!

group are together again!

<li>Most of the day was spent with Git.  In the morning, I learned that
setting <code>push.default</code> to <code>nothing</code> will prevent pushing any
branches without specifying explicitly which branch I want to push.
</li>
<li>Also, later in the day, Alan gave a presentation mapping the
internals of git to the commands, trying to give everyone a better
mental model of Git.
</li>
<li>I spent some time trying to get <code>jedi</code> integration for <code>emacs</code>. It
should've worked out of the box, but I'm not sure the ELPA
repositories have proper dependency/version management.  Seems to be
the problem, everywhere!  Dependencies of a package get updated, and
the package starts acting up…
</li>
<li>Chaitu sent me a link about solving mazes using Finite Automata, and
I spent some time trying to write a simple solver, and compare it
with Nava's breadth first search.  But, it looks like we broke her
code during the refactor.  I may get back to this, at some point.
</li>
<li>I also spent a few minutes talking to Kyle, while he was trying to
implement a simple version of the NTP protocol.  The algorithm it
turns out, is pretty simple.

<li>I started reading a little bit on crypt-analysis for Simple
Substitution ciphers, and I'll try implementing one of the

<li>I spent most of Saturday, thinking about what I should be doing for
the next few weeks, and what I really want to get out of Hacker
School.
</li>
<li>I had a good discussion with Naren about things that he works on,
and the kind of things that he sees as hard, what kind of things
interest me, and what I want to do post Hacker School.  I always
knew, I didn't really have an area of expertise or an area that I'm
super interested in, where I want to work.  This discussion only was
a verbalizing of those thoughts.
</li>
<li>I am not sure, I am very happy with the way I have been learning
Haskell.  The UPenn course has been reasonably good with the
exercises provided, and I have been learning through "pseudo"
projects.  But, I'm wondering if I should pick up a more concrete
project.
</li>
<li>I played around a little bit with Elm and started something to try
and write <a href="https://github.com/huckerdom/layout">Layout</a> using Elm.
</li>
<li>I tried cleaning up the phonebook problem from Friday. It works, but
can definitely be improved with some help from a more experienced
Haskeller.
</li>

    <ul class="org-ul">
<li>I finished parts of the phonebook task today.  The code looks ugly,
and very un-haskelly.  I asked for feedback on it, but I guess its
just too ugly for anyone to take the time out to comment on it, and
help me improve it.
</li>
<li>I also tried to read up about Monads, and worked through exercises
from a few different places.  I haven't yet finished the exercises
in Chapter 12 of the UPenn course.  I just looked at them today, and
they seem like a complete bouncer at first glance.
</li>
<li>I went on a really long walk with Naren, and food-hopped with him
while he was telling me stories about the various places he worked
at and the kinds of things he has been working on, and things he
liked and disliked about them.  It has been a good weekend to spend
with Naren!
</li>
<li>Also, the long walk and talking to Chaitu cleared my head a bit, and
I decided to pause the Haskell tutorials and learning for the next
couple of weeks.  I don't really have a project that needs me to
learn Haskell, right now.  I should stick to project and need based
learning, which I enjoy the most.
</li>
<li>Right now, I feel like working on an key stroke acoustic emanation
based key-logger.  Just before applying to Hacker School, I came
across the idea of side-channel attacks, and it sounded pretty
exciting.  I don't intend to snoop onto anybody, but the project
seems to be challenging enough, and I will have quite a bit to learn
about. It will involve signal processing, and learning – both areas
that I have seemed interesting to me for long, but I haven't really
done anything in them.  I plan to work on the idea for a couple of
weeks, and review my progress and chart my future course. The
problem appears to have 2 parts to it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Processing audio, and extracting key-strokes from it.
</li>
<li>Identifying the text, based on a sequence of key-strokes. Though,
in reality each press of a key may not sound the same, for a start
assuming we are able to accurately get a sequence of key-strokes,
the problem would reduce to solving a simple substitution cipher.
I plan to start with this, tomorrow.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, I plan to hang out a lot more with Hacker Schoolers, and let
myself be distracted a lot more by random discussions and
activities, than I have allowed myself to be, in the past few weeks.
I should be writing as much code as I can, while I'm here.  But, I
should also be rubbing elbows with the awesome folks, which I will
only be able to virtually, once I'm out of here.
</li>
<li>Thanks to Amber, I also came across this interesting looking book
called <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813">Apprenticeship patterns</a>.  I plan to read it over the next
week or two.
</li>
<li>I haven't been playing almost any Ultimate here. I atleast need to
work out a conditioning and throwing practice schedule and start
working on it, early next week.  Tomorrow won't work since it's 5am
and I'm still awake!
</li>
<li>I also probably need to get enough sleep!
</li>
<li>Looking forward to the next couple of weeks!

<h2 id="sec-1">Motivation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I was trying to pair on writing a simple app that uses Hacker
School's OAuth2 API, and hit a roadblock on the first step of
requesting an authorization from the user.  Once the user authorized
my app, I would see an error that said, "The authorization server
does not support this response type".  I was using a client library
that I had <a href="https://github.com/litl/rauth">used before</a>, and the server was using a what seemed like
a <a href="https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper">popular implementation</a> for ruby on rails.  Getting weird errors is
not done!
</p>

<p>
I have used OAuth2 based authentication <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/statiki/blob/master/statiki.py#L49">before</a>, but the thought of
using it always makes me a little nervous, just because
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I don't understand it very well.
</li>
<li>Like almost everything else, there seem to be so many libraries
for doing this in Python, and I'm never sure which one to use, or
which one I used the last time around.  Not understanding the
protocol also doesn't let me debug anything that comes up.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
To fix this, I set about to read and understand the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth2 protocol</a>.
This blog post is an attempt to record it for future reference, and
possibly act as a reference for others.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Why OAuth</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
OAuth is simply a way for an end-user to allow third parties to use
protected data, without sharing the user's credentials with the
third-party.
</p>

<p>
For example, an end-user (Jane) can grant a printing service
(Printo) access to her protected photos stored at a photo-sharing
service (Picasa), without sharing her username and password with the
printing service.  Instead, she authenticates directly with a server
trusted by the photo-sharing service, which issues the printing
service delegation-specific credentials. (example from the OAuth 2.0
spec)
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Protocol Flow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<img src="/images/536281e1af42c5729864722aa6e9019ef9e93c0a.png"><p>
The flow occurs through a sequence of user actions, client requests
and user-agent (browser) redirects.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(A) Printo asks Jane to allow using Picasa Data. The request can
be sent directly to Jane, but is usually routed via
Picasa/Google.
</li>

<li>(B) Printo gets back an authorization grant, which is a
credential representing Jane's authorization or approval.  The
type of the actual grant credential depends on the type of
request that Printo used.
</li>

<li>(C, D) Printo gets back to Google with the credentials it obtained
in the previous step and obtains a token that it can use to talk
with Picasa.
</li>

<li>(E, F) Printo asks for the desired photo with the token it
obtained previously, and Picasa gives back the photo to print.
Jane gets her framed photo!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But before any of this happens, the client needs to register with
the authorization server and obtain a <code>client_id</code> and
<code>client_secret</code>, that will be used to identify the client making
the requests.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Pythonized "authorization code" work-flow.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The OAuth2 spec allows the authorization request/grant to be of 4
different types.  It also allows some flexibility in the token
type.
</p>

<p>
In my experience, the most common work-flow seems to be using an
<i>authorization code</i> as an authorization grant, and using a <i>Bearer</i>
type token.  This work-flow is explained in the diagram below (taken
from the spec document).  This diagram zooms in, onto the steps A-D
in the diagram above.

This <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/76e8771fc26cd243f3ac">python code snippet</a> is a simple implementation of this
workflow, using the Hacker School API.

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
I think, I understand the OAuth2 spec a lot better now, and hope
that this will help others understand it, too.  And more
importantly, I won't get nervous when I have to add it to my
projects.
</p>

<p>
Also, <a href="https://github.com/idan/oauthlib">oauthlib</a> for Python seems to be a pretty thorough
implementation of the spec, and <a href="https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib">requests-oauthlib</a> seems to wrap it
for use with requests.  I think I'm going to use this in my future
projects.

finish (actually, start) the last chapter in the UPenn course
(Monads).  I hope to finish it during the weekend.

<li>I started with reading <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia">Typeclassopedia</a>, in the hope of getting
comfortable with Functors and Applicatives and to get introduced to
Monads.  But, I got distracted before I got to the end of the part
on Functors.

<li>During the check-ins, Laura and Denise mentioned that they are both
facing problems with OAuth, and would like to pair on it.  I decided
to join them, since I've had reasonable luck with OAuth, though I
knew I didn't understand it very well.  While they were working on
getting it to work on OSX, I was trying to write a simple Python
example to do it, and was getting a weird error about the
<code>response_type</code> being not supported.  I was using <a href="https://github.com/litl/rauth">rauth</a> in a way
very similar to what I had done for <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/statiki/blob/master/statiki.py#L49">statiki</a> but the Hacker School
API server wasn't letting me through.  I could debug it only a
little before lunch, and a little bit after lunch.  And realized
that the <code>response_type</code> had to be one of <code>code</code> or <code>token</code> and not
<code>json</code> or <code>empty</code>.  But this is a required parameter, and I expected
<code>rauth</code> to do the right thing!  I got back to it at the end of the
day, and went through the RFC for OAuth2 and wrote up a simple
Python script to implement the whole thing, without using any 3rd
party oauth libraries.  I think I understand the whole thing much
better now, and will soon write up a blog post on it.
</li>

<li>I spent about an hour or so on reviewing Nava's code (along with
Tom, Amber and Patricia), that generated and solved mazes. We tried
to make small incremental changes to her code, and improve it,
hopefully giving her a sense of how to make the code more
intentional.

<li>Thursday evening presentations! People here have been working on
such cool stuff!  Maze solvers and percolation probability
calculators, phone gap based mobile applications, a cool Midi based
music generator, an <a href="https://github.com/mveytsman/emm-ess-pee">emulator</a> for MSP430 in Clojure, an event logger
in ObjectiveC that can log to a web server and can be used by
multiple clients to debug communication related issues, a HTTP
server written from Scratch, a web server in Swift, a pattern
matching based library in js, a heuristics based puzzle solver, and
a web editor for jekyll!  Holy cow!  These presentations are
extremely inspiring and will probably be the thing I look forward to
the most, for the next 10 weeks.

to do me much good. I feel distracted for quite a long period before
the scheduled time.
</li>
<li>Abstractions and layers were talked about in the second exercise on
Applicatives… Layering, FTW!
</li>
<li>I spent about an hour or so in the afternoon reading the paper, <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gkrichar/papers/onward2013-wuerthinger-truffle.pdf">One
VM to rule them all</a>.  It talked about Truffle: an API to implement
an AST parser for any language and Graal: a JIT compiler for the
ASTs.  Later in the day, I also went to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/events/178049922/">Papers we love</a> meetup.
The presentation and the talks were quite interesting!
</li>
<li>I also started looking at <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a> and playing with it.

<li>I've been bookmarking the interesting links that people post on
Zulip and have a lot of reading to do.   It would be nice if I had
an easy way to send stuff on to my kindle. (pdfs, html, etc.).
Instapaper works, but doesn't work as well as I would like it to.  I
just want a simple script that takes a list of urls and does the
right thing.  May be I will write something that uses Calibre, or
even better someone already has.
</li>
<li>I worked through exercises 08 and 10 of the haskell course,
yesterday.
</li>
<li>Chapter 8 was about how IO works in haskell.  The exercise didn't
involve too much, except I wasted a lot of time on tracking a
stupidity of mine.
</li>
<li>The next part of the course was an introduction to Functors,
Applicative and Alternative.  I'm not sure I totally understand and
am comfortable with them, but I have been able to get through the
exercises.
</li>
<li>I think it's time for me to start working on some Elm tutorials,
along with the Haskell exercises.
</li>
<li>Also, I had questions about when to use <code>type</code>, <code>newtype</code> and <code>data</code>
and incidentally found <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids#the-newtype-keyword">this section</a> that ended with the following
summary: "If you just want your type signatures to look cleaner and
be more descriptive, you probably want <code>type</code> synonyms. If you want
to take an existing type and wrap it in a new type in order to make
it an instance of a type class, chances are you're looking for a
<code>newtype</code>.  And if you want to make something completely new, odds
are good that you're looking for the <code>data</code> keyword."

<li>Didn't do anything during the weekend.  Hopefully, this won't be the
case all of the weekends.  I had fun with my cousins, though.
</li>
<li>Denise is already working on a twitter app that sounds similar to
the idea I had.
</li>
<li>I accidentally discovered that evince supports vim-like keybindings,
which is cool.
</li>
<li>When writing patterns for a function it helps to write the most
general case first, and then write the edge cases.
</li>
<li>I was feeling a little unproductive in the afternoon and I ended up
attending Zach's talk on <a href="https://github.com/hackerschool/community">Community</a>.  I got a brief overview of the
whole architecture, and got to know a little bit about reactjs and
om. I don't think I'll get around to contributing to the project,
since most of the stack is totally new to me, and I'm not
particularly inclined to learn those things now.
</li>
<li>I was working on Monoids for most part of the day and got through
exercise 7.  I started doing the I/O exercise around the end of the
day.
</li>
<li>The day ended with a talk on jobs related stuff by Nick and Sonali.
It seems super unlikely for me to get a job (in the US), from what I
understood from them.  So, I needn't worry too much about that and
focus on getting better at Haskel and as a programmer in general.
