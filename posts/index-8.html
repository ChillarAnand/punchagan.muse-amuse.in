I've often got bad service from "service providers" - hotels,
restaurants, phone services, Internet services etc. I guess that's
due to the population in India. If one customer goes back unhappy
that doesn't really make a difference, because there would be
hundred others already waiting in the queue.
</p>

<p>
You, as a, service provider would get your share of customers and
profits, no matter how bad you are. Thanks to the population.
</p>

<p>
One solution could be, to write about the bad service you got from
a provider and make people aware of it, but often there aren't
enough options, for others to choose from. Inevitably, the bad
service provider is going to get some customers. What's the way
out?

 For the uninitiated, vimperator is an emacs plugin to get Firefox
working with vim keybindings and firemacs <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/vimperator-and-firemacs.html#fn.1">1</a></sup> is for emacs keybindings.
</p>

<p>
I'm obsessed with emacs (as should already be evident) and can't
really edit text without it's key-bindings. There are others like me,
and hence the firemacs plugin. It's a blessing for my tribe.
</p>

<p>
Firemacs is great, except for the one great feature that it lacks -
being able to jump to links/textareas without using the mouse.  I've
seen Nishanth do it with ease, using Vimperator. I wanted to add this
feature to Firemacs, by copying some code from Vimperator to
Firemacs.  I directly started looking at the code, but couldn't make
head or tail of it. I got a few doubts about how Vimperator works,
since I'd never used it. Nishanth asked me to simply install it and
try it out.
</p>

<p>
And then we had our EUREKA! moment. Vimperator and Emacs both
enabled together work seamlessly well. Two obsessed people are happy
and satisfied! And hopefully many more. :D

After a trek, I had an interesting conversation with Ritesh, about
taking pictures during a trip. He said, he started to realize that
when he's lost in the cycle of click, see, analyze, click,
… when he's got a cam in his hand. He didn't have a cam on this
trek and thoroughly enjoyed it!
</p>

<p>
I connect to this phenomenon, as well. I think, like Ritesh says,
having separate trips for Photography makes sense. On other trips,
we could be clicking, but just for the sake of memory. Trying to
get amazing photographs shouldn't be a goal.
I should refrain from -
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>looking at the output and adjusting repeatedly until it's
perfect.
</li>
<li>clicking too many pictures in a given length of time.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For both of this, a film camera seems to be the solution!
</p>

<p>
What say, Ritesh?

Sage Days is a confluence of present and prospective SAGE Users and
Developers. It is an opportunity to come together to share ideas,
brainstorm and hack on Sage. Sage Days 25 is the 25th version of Sage
Days, and is being organized in Mumbai, India. In order to cater to an
Indian audience and scenario, this version has been tweaked
slightly. Sage Days 25 has beginner level tutorials, in addition to
the usual talks and sprints, to help new users get started with Sage
and help promote the use of Sage in India.

<h2 id="sec-2">What is Sage?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Sage is a free, open-source mathematics software system licensed under
the GPL. It combines the power of numerous existing open-source
packages into a common Python-based interface. It's mission is to
create a "viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple,
Mathematica and Matlab". Sage has tools for a broad range of
mathematical areas like Linear Algebra, Calculus, Symbolic Math,
Plotting, Rings &amp; Groups, Graph Theory, Number Theory and
Cryptography. Essentially, "it can do anything from mapping a
12-dimensional object to calculating rainfall patterns under global
warming" - as Science Daily puts it . Eager to get started? Start
here. Apart from being feature rich, it's usability is one of it's
greatest strengths. Sage Notebook, a web-interface for all the math
you'll ever want to do, is really the killer feature! As the Sage
Marketing page says, "The SAGE GUI surely works on your computer box,
because it just runs in Firefox!". Try it Now!

Sage Days 25 is being attended by the creator and lead developer of
Sage, Prof. William Stein. It will also be attended by other
developers of Sage. This would be a great opportunity to meet and
interact with them! The conference will be attended by a plethora of
enthusiastic people from all over the country who use Sage or are
interested in doing so. The conference will also see the presence of
many mathematicians interested in software. Who knows, you may run
into someone you'd want to collaborate with, for your future work!
This event will be a great learning experience, if you are even
remotely interested in math and software for it!

<del>I'd</del> We had been on a 60 km long trip today. My second one, and
Ritesh's first. The map of our route is here. On the whole the ride
was wonderful! A thoroughly enjoyable one. It was near perfect, with
it raining only as much as we enjoyed an not anymore. :)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The ride on Godbander Road was the most enjoyable part of the
ride. Simple Wonderful! That's what made the trip worth it!
</li>

<li>It was more relaxed than my previous ride and it took us about 5
hours on the whole. We must've been pedalling for about 4 hours. I
don't have the "actual" figures.
</li>

<li>Except for the stretch of Western express highway (service road)
from Jogeshwari to a little after the Sanjay Gandhi National park's
entrance, the road was decent. The Eastern Express highway service
road was awesome!
</li>

<li>Cycling alone is totally different from cycling with someone
else. We didn't really go together, but we were meeting up once in a
while. The loneliness, of rides on which you are alone, is
absent. But waiting for, or catching up with the other guy is a bit
tricky. I wonder how it would be with a bigger group.
</li>

<li>I tried to keep going at about 60% effort and I still had quite a
bit of juice left in me, at the end of the ride.
</li>

<li>My cycle is definitely good! I really only understood this after
exchanging my cycle.
</li>

<li>Exchanging cycles felt nice. A slightly different set of muscles
were in action. The newness kinda helped.
</li>

<li>I should probably get myself a bigger round frame spectacles. Or I'm
craning my neck a bit too much, to keep looking ahead, while
pedaling. How about contacts?
</li>

<li>The problem with riding on the left of Highways is that you
"compete" with heavy vehicles. It sometimes gets a bit scary.
</li>

<li>I should get a helmet soon.
</li>

<li>I should get in touch with local cycling groups and tag along with
them on a couple of rides. I'll get to learn a lot of things.
</li>

<li>Ritesh took a few pics with his phone. <del>Photos in some later post or
with an update</del>.
</li>

<li>Where to next? A ride inside the National park, probably or the
wonderful roads of Navi Mumbai.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Kudos Ritesh!
</p>

<p>
<b>UPDATE:</b> A few pictures, that Ritesh clicked on his phone. All the
photos were on the Godbander Road.

After a short break, I'm back to blogging!
A few things have changed meanwhile. A lot haven't.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Noetic Nought shall now be called Rustic Reverie.
</li>

<li>The Blogs I read page is now manually populated. More pages might be
coming soon.
</li>

<li>My web presence has almost been reduced to just this blog. I hope to
be blogging more often this time around. I guess I'll have shorter
and more frequent posts. "Release early, Release often."
</li>

<li>I've been inspired by Sacha Chua and her wonderful blog. She puts up
anything that -
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>she may look up in future.
</li>
<li>could be remotely useful to anybody on this planet.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I like her idea of "thinking of writing as sketching". "Keep
repeating yourself, until the core message floats to the top". It
feels similar to the idea - "Release early, Release often."
</p>
</li>

<li>Also, Thanks to Madhu and Vattam who set an impossibly high standard
by having their resumes and letters of recommendations and other
"personal" stuff on version control on public repositories.
</li>

<li>All my posts will be made from org2blog - a little org-mode based
client that I hacked up. Emacs and Org-mode all the way! This is the
first post by me (and probably anybody) from org2blog!

I, Noetic Nought, shall remain shut for the next few months.

My owner wishes to be a by-stander, watching the world rush past
him, for the next few months atleast. He may (or not) return to
me. I hope, he does.

Bye all.

I want to be a part of the "reader-space" of blogs or web-sites
rather than a part of the Google-reader ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
As most of my readers know, I'm big on Google Reader (and I have a
reputation for that!). I'm a part of a wonderful ecosystem and get
to look-at or read a lot of interesting stuff. I get a lot of
variety, stuff that I wouldn't normally have come across. It keeps
me from staying in a tiny well, reading the same kind of stuff,
over and over again. I also like the fact that it acts as an
archival system for me. I can go back and read posts, which don't
exist on the web, anymore.
</p>

<p>
But, I have a problem with this ecosystem. It's killing the the
communities around the blogs or sites, themselves. The reader
count may have gone up, but the discussion and activity of the
community on the blogs is going down; at least on the blogs I look
at. Blogs are rather dead, these days. But, when one's following
over 200 blogs, you can't expect much better. It is difficult to
keep up with all of them; even the ones that one kept up well
with, before. People stop going back to the comments; stop
participating in the discussion.
</p>

<p>
Do you agree? Do you think it'll help it feed readers keep track
of the comments and updates? Or is the only way to cut down on
feed-reading and getting back to the old exciting way of checking
out blogs? I recall an old quote I read - If it's not worth
remembering, it's not worth reading.
</p>

<p>
<b>UPDATE:</b> I wasn't talking of my blog or comments here, in
 particular (if that's not already clear). I was talking of blogs,
 that I read regularly, blogs of people I know well (including
 mine). But then, there are blogs, that have over 1000 comments on
 a single post, too. Should the above quote could be changed to
 read - "If it's not worth reading, it's not worth remembering." ?

A Rocking.. err.. Pebbling.. err.. Pedaling Trip. IIT Bombay,
Powai to the Gateway of India. I simply loved it!
</p>

<p>
The original plan was to land somewhere near Chowpatty beach, but
I had some useless landmarks and I got lost. I was not too
particular about going to a particular place, so didn't try too
hard to stay on track and was happy to end up at the
Gateway. Thanks to the Mumbai local, I don't know the road
routes. But, again thanks to the Mumbai local, I have a general
idea of the direction.
</p>

<p>
I woke up a bit later than scheduled, but almost made up for the
delay until I reach my cycle to find the rear tyre fully flat. I
quickly diagnosed the problem to be with the valve. But, I had no
spare valve, unless, I "borrow" it from a cycle near-by. I
replaced my valve with Vattam's cycle's and was good to go!
</p>

<p>
I didn't have a big enough water bottle, and carried along only
half a litre after drinking one half litre. The first half hour
was a breeze; possibly the best part of the whole ride. High on
energy and enthu. Then, my groin/ass started to hurt a bit. I
pulled out my music player to drown the pain in music. This kinda
worked and I pulled on pretty well until King's circle. That's
when I emptied all the water I had. I hoped to find water along
the way, if I badly needed it.
</p>

<p>
Sometime later, I had to take a right turn, but I never knew
where. I didn't bother to ask anyone, nor did I look at the
landmarks I had scribbled down. I was happy to go straight
ahead. :)
</p>

<p>
And by the time I reached CST/Fort, I did need water; badly
enough. I stopped at the next open shop (that was not a
pan-ki-dukaan) and got myself some Nimbu paani and a litre of
water (for future).
</p>

<p>
The Gateway of India was just 10 minutes away from here.  Loitered
around there, for about 40 minutes. There were a lot of Policemen
all over the place. After about 5 minutes of me reaching there,
they cleared the whole area right next to the Gateway of India. I
don't know why. (Also, all along the way, there were a lot of men
in Khaaki. I guess there's some rally or some such thing
scheduled)
</p>

<p>
On the return, I lost my way almost immediately after
starting. There was a one way road that I avoided and took the
adjacent road but ended up going off-track. I had some doubts
about this but they weren't confirmed until I reached Mahalaxmi
station! But there, a Taxi driver gave me rough guidelines to get
back on my track. I turned back and soon was "back-on-track".
</p>

<p>
I'd planned to have breakfast at Idli house, as soon as I saw it
during my onward journey. So, I went directly to Idli house, and
treated myself to a Rava idli and some wonderful Kaapi. The waiter
got tipped well, too. ;)
</p>

<p>
From Matunga, back to IIT was straight forward; except for the
growing traffic and the PITA (literally). The traffic signals were
a bit annoying, too.
</p>

<p>
On the whole was an awesome trip! I loved it. Hope to go on more
such rides. But, I guess I'll head north-ward, the next time.
</p>

<p>
By the way, it was approx. 60kms on the whole and took me 5 hours
(including the time I spent at the Gateway of India) with about 3
hours 40 mins of pedaling.. err.. rocking. :D
