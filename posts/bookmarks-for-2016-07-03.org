Bennett launched a Kickstarter in 2015 to fund 200 hours of sitting and
smiling. It was unsuccessful but it didn't stop him from doing it anyway.

It is our duty to spend our time working to surrender, dismantle, and destroy
these structures that steal time and invite death. We designed them to heed and
obey the will of whiteness, we filled them with white guardians, and we trained
them to reproduce white wealth, the most treasured byproduct of white time.

 I am not a boogeyman. I am not a wild bear, or a stingray, or a spider
  crawling through your space. I‚Äôm the same as you, and if you‚Äôre afraid of me,
  you should be just as afraid of yourself.

I‚Äôm tired of silence. I‚Äôm tired of the people who want to continue to live
their lives, as though nothing were wrong, meeting the execution of citizens
with a shrug. As though their lives were not corrupted by their silent sanction
of our slaughter. And I‚Äôm tired of the fact that I can‚Äôt even put my words to
paper without another life exploding on national television. May Philando
Castile rest in peace.

Read as much as you possibly can ‚Äî but never forget to apply what you‚Äôve
learned because that is what counts the most. You put in many hours to read
books, make sure you get something out of it.

These are the books I refer to often‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsome books are timeless and get better
as you study them. There‚Äôs a real difference between reading a book for the
first time, and reading it for the second time. And so forth. Here are 5
books that I reread every year. And every year, they become better and more
useful to me.

Not every company has to claim to solve problems that change the world. As is
clear from recent examples in the media, vision at the expense of truth can
have huge repercussions for both consumers and investors alike. Not only this,
but the lack of humility and the sprinkle of spin distracts us from what‚Äôs
really important. Humanity‚Äôs grandest challenges.

Who you are is defined by the values you are willing to struggle for. People
who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who get in good shape. People who
enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who
move up it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainty of the starving
artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.

This is a post about some sentences used in technical presentations that sound

feel bad about their level of knowledge. These are the following sentences and

bringing up everything that you have hidden, repressed, covered and locked
up. It will be a tough journey, but will only lead you to a place where you can
finally create and do meaningful work that brings the fulfilment you crave.

A while back I wrote about why I work hard. I mentioned that my mentor taught
me to rest before I get tired. Weirdly enough, resting can be a different
thing; especially if you want to achieve your goals. But it‚Äôs also
necessary. Rest and work go hand in hand.


- [[https://medium.com/@ctaylormpearson/5-mental-models-that-create-dramatic-leverage-ef186bc9bdce#.82pw4bw24][5 Mental Models That Create Dramatic Leverage ‚Äî Medium]]
One of the concepts central to systems thinking is the idea of levers and
leverage points. In any given system at any given time, certain activities at
certain times provide more leverage than at others. So I started thinking
about different mental models of leverage points that I‚Äôve found both in my own
experience and through reading.

- [[https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/][Creating a Latticework of Mental Models: An Introduction]]
The truth is that the good ideas are just as dangerous as the bad ones. Warren
Buffett‚Äôs mentor, Ben Graham, used to put it as such:  You can get in way
more trouble with a¬†good idea¬†than a¬†bad idea, because you forget that the¬†good
idea¬†has limits.  The best antidote to this sort of¬†overreaching is to add
more colors to your mental palette; to expand your repertoire of ideas, make
them vivid and available, and watch your mind grow.  You‚Äôll know you‚Äôre on
to something when the ideas start to compete with one another. At first, this
is mildly uncomfortable. One idea says X and the other idea says the reverse of
X: How do I decide which is right?  This¬†process of letting the models
compete and fight for superiority and greater fundamentalness is
called¬†thinking! It‚Äôs a little like learning to walk or ride a bike;¬†at first
you can‚Äôt believe all that you‚Äôre supposed to do at once, but eventually you
wonder how you ever¬†got along without it. As Charlie likes to say, going back
to any other method would feel like cutting off your hands.

This post is my attempt to enumerate the mental models that are repeatedly
useful to me. This set is clearly biased from my own experience and surely
incomplete. I hope to continue to revise it as I remember and learn more.

the young is discovering. The joy of the old is relishing.

In an alternate reality most people have a 'grain' implanted behind their ear
that records everything they do, see or hear. This allows memories to be played
back either in front of the person's eyes or on a screen, a process known as a
're-do'.

In the year 2016, we continue to believe that the best approach to a child's
curiosities about sex and more, is suppression. Here's a newsflash: it doesn't
work. All we end up doing by telling girls that honour resides in their bodies
is that we cause them shame when they are molested or raped. Dishonour should
be attributed to the person who commits such terrible acts, and not the
victim.
