- A bunch of worked on getting LEDs to blink, by writing some assembly code.

- I goofed off post-lunch, and cleaned up the code for the Google Translate
  based TTS client.

- I tried to continue working on the bencode parser, to add support for
  dictionaries, but I couldn't get much work done before it was time for the
  Monday talk.
