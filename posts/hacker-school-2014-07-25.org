- We worked on writing our own (toy) version control system on Friday, as a
  part of job prep.  I paired with Sophia, and we got upto the point where we
  had diffs working, when we decided to refactor the code with some tests and
  stuff.
- The party was brilliant with a lot of activity.  All the project
  installations looked so cool, and it was so much fun!
- I spent some time during the weekend watching the "Anatomy of Matplotlib"
  lectures.
- I started some work with poking around Matplotlib's template backend, and
  trying to start writing and ascii backend.
- Also, I was trying to help UC setup [[https://github.com/andrewrk/groovebasin][GrooveBasin]] on his raspberry pi, and
  helped him configure [[https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client][jasper]] on it.
