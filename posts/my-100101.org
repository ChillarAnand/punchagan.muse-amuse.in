#+END_COMMENT


Just dumping my list of potential projects here, for now.  I may or may not end
up doing any of the projects, depending on how life goes, but just writing them
down makes me feel good!

1. Build your own email tracker.  Hidden images in emails
2. Analytics like Google based on server logs?
3. Aggregator for India Ultimate events/photos/news
4. Simple bot that can answer a handful of questions in Natural language
   irrespective of words used and sentence formation.
5. Food intake tracker -- use an image based API that I think someone came up with
6. Food suggestions, based on intake and activity and suggested intake.
7. Music listening tracker and suggestions based on mood and history.
8. Digg deeper clone -- tweets to feed reader
9. Tweetdeck clone with columns by topics; tweets are classified automatically
   instead of manual creation of lists.
10. Code refactor tool (for Python?) for Emacs
11. Code re-use suggestions in a project or in an organization -- scoring and
    similarity measures for blocks of code?
12. Simple Pebble app for keeping track of Ultimate progress?
13. ~mpsyt~ mode improvements -- repetition, history, playlists, autoplay in
    other buffers, etc.
14. (Pebble based?) Sleep tracker that doesn't sell my data
15. Natural language to SQL
16. Context/Location aware TODO suggestions -- take into account what I'm doing
    (walking, at home, office) and how much time I have before a scheduled
    event, or how long I am going to spend on the bus, etc.
17. Web-interface or Anki two-way sync for org-drill.
18. Start-up name generator
19. Personal music/video history across sites and on laptop/phone.
    Recommendations based on that?
20. Whatsapp groups <-> Google groups gateway
21. ML based scraper -- should be robust to changes in page structure. Some
    semantic structure deduction, etc
22. Implement an SQLITE DB -- the docs are pretty good, I believe.  I could sit
    down and read stuff and implement things.
23. India city data - safety in terms of natural disasters. Some data analysis
    on the sort of things that happened in Chennai?  Find 2nd tier alternative
    cities etc?
24. Something to do with GitHub data for Indians
25. GitHub organization weekly dashboard
26. Something to do with Meetup data -- meetups have low turn outs. Insights
    into that? Or atleast a trend by place and number of real attendees. Data
    may be hard to get.
27. Manager for Nikola posts. List by tags, etc.  Some sort of sql queries
    plugin -- date, tags, title, text.
28. Desktop notifications to my phone. Over blue tooth or something. Just want
    a way to not keep staring at my screen and be notified when a task
    finishes, for instance.
29. View daily work journal items easily to see progress made. Items with time
    stamps on a particular day need to be shown.
30. Gists don't have comments. Implement a browser plugin that adds this --
    using some additional metadata for line number etc. + message saved as
    normal comments. Version changes will need to be handled smartly.
31. whatshouldireadnext.com clone

* Camlistore

1. Import emails
2. Browser tabs and web pages
3. This day that year -- spaced repetition of events in life
4. Howdy built on top of Camlistore
5. Google Now clone on top of Camlistore? Habits and stuff included.
6. Gyroscope clone on top of Camlistore
   1. Org-mode task importer/exporter
   2. Workrave importer
   3. arbtt importer/Rescue time
   4. Bunch of others can be added looking at Gyroscope
