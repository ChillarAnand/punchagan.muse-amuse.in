[[http://twitter.com/avudem][Voodoo]] found a broken link referring to a one of my posts, on Quora.
Given that I have changed my site generator a bunch of times now, it
is quite possible that there are other broken links at various other
places.  So, I implemented a smart [[http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/this-is-a-fun-hack][404 page]] for the site, yesterday.
It is very similar to something I came across on [[http://brettterpstra.com/2013/04/07/fun-with-intelligent-404-pages/][brettterpstra]]'s site.
I just [[http://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/assets/js/suggestions.js][hooked up]] [[http://kiro.me/projects/fuse.html][fuse.js]] with Nikola's [[http://getnikola.com/handbook.html#local-search][tipue-search plugin]]'s output
file.  My glue code essentially, just figures out the search term from
the URL, performs a Fuse search on the json data created by Nikola's
search plugin, and returns a list of top 5 results.  It just took me
about an hour to write, but is pretty useful, I think.
