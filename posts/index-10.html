You are there for one reason - to train hard, and to focus on all
the things you need to be doing right - stance, breathing, form,
recovery, chalking up, everything - and do them right. Quit faffing
around!
</p>

<p>
A training session is about an hour long, of mostly lifting stuff
and time between lifting stuff, where you recover. If this isn't
what you do, sleeping in is a better option.

The next time you see an application you like, think very long and
hard about all the user-oriented details that went into making it a
pleasure to use, before decrying how you could trivially reimplement
the entire damn thing in a weekend. Nine times out of ten, when you
think an application was ridiculously easy to implement, you’re
completely missing the user side of the story.

<a href="http://housesofgoa.com/about.html">Houses of Goa - About the Project</a>

<p>
The history of Goa is intrinsically linked to the many centuries of
Portuguese presence and rule. Before the arrival of the Portuguese,
most Goan houses were mostly made of mud and had a thatched
roof. They faced inwards towards a central courtyard and had small
windows, mostly devoid of ornaments.
</p>

<p>
The Portuguese arrived in Goa in 1510 and brought with them a host
of cultural and aesthetic influences from Europe and other
places. Goans who travelled abroad also returned with ideas and
influences from other countries that they incorporated into their
houses.

“If you want to describe a specific person in detail, I cannot do it

Born of human error, continually generating copious heat, the
Elephant’s Foot is still melting into the base of the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant. If it hits ground water, it could trigger
another catastrophic explosion or leech radioactive material into
the water nearby residents drink. Long after bleeding from the core,
this unique piece of waste continues to be a testament to the
potential dangers of nuclear power. The Elephant’s Foot will be
there for centuries, sitting in the dark basement of a concrete and

I told you before that the purpose of mathematics is insight, but I
think I lied. Even more than that, the reason I do math is the
excitement and uncertainty of the chase. There is no joy in applying
a computer algorithm, but there is joy in unlocking the delicate
clockwork mechanism that makes a good math problem tick. And, in the
end, you just might learn something that nobody else in the world
knows!

<p>
… Oh, and by the way, I really don’t believe that honesty is merely
a wasted opportunity to cheat. I said that just for effect. Honest.

the cube begins to solve itself, and all you have to do is follow
along and you will have solved your cube!

<p>
As we prepare body and soul for the gluttony and giving nearly upon
us, Jason Silva presents us with an intellectual antidote; an
incredible and excitable selection of books that thinks a little
bigger than exactly how many brussels sprouts we will be expected to
eat in the coming weeks. Web-wide courted themes of The Singualrity,
group consciousness and technology’s expectation of us, the
synthesis of the human condition and (why not?) immortality – all
are to be found in the permanent pages of this wonderfully
accessible selection of books on Silva’s Bookshelf.
