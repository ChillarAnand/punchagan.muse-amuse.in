    <p>
<a href="http://binchen.org/">Chen Bin</a> asked me to share my Nikola+Org work-flow, and share an
example post.
</p>

<p>
The org source for any post can be found by changing the URL of a post
from <code>.html</code> to <code>.org</code>.
</p>

<p>
I don't have much of a work-flow, because I don't post too often, but
here is what I typically do, to make a new post.
</p>

<p>
I start off by creating a new post using
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nikola new_post
</pre></div>

<p>
and then give the post a title and start editing the post in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
I have a simple snippet that lets me insert tags, based on existing
tags.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/6629020.js"></script><p>
Once I'm happy with the content of a post, I run <code>nikola auto</code> to
build the source and serve it locally, and see if the post "looks"
reasonable, after being rendered.
</p>

<p>
Once, I'm happy with it, I commit the post and deploy it using <code>nikola
deploy</code>.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># "rsync -rav output/* joe@my.site:/srv/www/site"</span>
<span class="c1"># And then do a backup, or ping pingomatic.</span>
<span class="c1"># To do manual deployment, set it to []</span>
<span class="n">DEPLOY_COMMANDS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">'default'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>

	<span class="s1">'rm -f cache/pages/index.html'</span><span class="p">,</span>

	<span class="s1">'git checkout master'</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="s1">'nikola build'</span><span class="p">,</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
I also have a plugin, that posts captured bookmarks and quotes onto
the blog, with a single command. I should probably make the sources of
my blog open, and push it onto GitHub.

At home, my video would always show a silhouette in G+ and Skype, and
I always thought that this was because the lighting at home was not
sufficient.  At office, the video was decent.  But, moving to sit
right under the light also didn't help much.
</p>

<p>
Struggling with a bunch of tools like <code>v4lctl</code>, <code>guvcview</code> didn't
help. But, during these struggles I noticed that <code>cheese</code> would show
me bright and cheerful, while all the other programs showed my
silhouette.
</p>

<p>
I set out to "fake" the output of <code>cheese</code> as a video device that
skype and other programs could use. But, I didn't have to go all the
way.  I ended up using <a href="https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback/">v4l2loopback</a> to create a loopback video device,
and just using <code>gst-launch</code> to redirect video to that device, did the
trick!  Thanks gstreamer!  Thanks v4l2loopback! :)

Git can be accurately understood as a fairly simple functional data
structure. Instead of explaining Git in terms version control, we
can see the ability to do version control as an emergent property of
using that data structure. I think talking about Git in this manner
will more accurately convey the simplicity and power of Git better
than any comparisons with centralized version control systems can
accomplish.

how do you determine a need that isn't being fulfilled and might be

needlessly difficult in your own life.

<p>
Dewey-Hagborg’s work is super interesting, not to mention searingly
contemporary. “It’s a very accessible way for the public to engage
with this new technology. It really brings to light how powerful it
is, the idea that a hair from your head can fall on your street and
a perfect stranger can pick it up and know something about it,” she
says, adding: “With DNA sequencing becoming faster and cheaper, this
is the world we’re all going to be living in.”

Standing up all day can be tough at first, but I'm much happier

you'll feel like you've done more than just think and type.

<p>
If the counter is displayed during the meeting, then everyone can
decide whether or not the meeting is generating a sensible
return. Whoever has the courage to call off a meeting on the grounds
it probably isn't worth it should get 10% of the expected meeting
costs saved to spend on a project of their choice (no meetings
allowed ;-).

Here is an interesting exercise in grayscale image processing, The
goal is to remove some (nearly) horizontal lines from a scanned
image, so that it is not obvious that the lines were ever there. The
image is a pencil drawing that has relatively light pencil marks
over dark lines that were printed on a ruled pad. The subject is

<p>
So many books, so little time. With this in mind, the Amazon Books
editors set out to compile a list of 100 Books to Read in a
Lifetime. We had a few goals when we started out: We wanted the list
to cover all stages of a life (which is why you'll find children's
books in here), and we didn't want the list to feel like
homework. Of course, no such list can be comprehensive – our lives,
we hope, are long and varied – but we talked and argued and sifted
and argued some more and came up with a list, our list, of
favorites.

Do whatever you want.

Don't take VC because Twitter did. Don't piss off investors because
37signals likes to. Do whatever you want, whatever works best for
you, what makes you the most comfortable and seems like the best
idea. Do what you love.

And, in the end, that's really the purpose of a web-based content
creation interface—accepting something as quickly as possible to
make the user happy enough to continue submitting more. The other
part of the user interface, retrieval, serves simply to get the
original content distributed as fast as can be reasonably expected.
