<p>
So many books, so little time. With this in mind, the Amazon Books
editors set out to compile a list of 100 Books to Read in a
Lifetime. We had a few goals when we started out: We wanted the list
to cover all stages of a life (which is why you'll find children's
books in here), and we didn't want the list to feel like
homework. Of course, no such list can be comprehensive – our lives,
we hope, are long and varied – but we talked and argued and sifted
and argued some more and came up with a list, our list, of
favorites.

<p>
Any software project is a collaborative project. It has at least two
developers, the original developer and the original developer a few
weeks or months later when the train of thought has long left the
station. This later self needs to reestablish the context of a
particular piece of code each time a new bug occurs or a new feature
needs to be implemented.
</p>

<p>
Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can't
avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it to as
small as possible. Commit messages can do exactly that and as a
result, a commit message shows whether a developer is a good
collaborator.

<p>
The best approach is more indirect: if you have the right sort of
background, good startup ideas will seem obvious to you. But even
then, not immediately. It takes time to come across situations where
you notice something missing. And often these gaps won't seem to be
ideas for companies, just things that would be interesting to
build. Which is why it's good to have the time and the inclination
to build things just because they're interesting.
</p>

<p>
Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it
sounds, that's the real recipe.

I was playing around with a few ideas for creating a timeline for the

that idea, I ended up wanting to scrape all the emails on our google
group.  After looking around a little bit, I failed to find anything
that claims to be able to do this.

<p>
So I ended up writing my own <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/7947337">hacky script</a> to download all the emails
sent on the group.  Like I said, this is a hack and can be improved
quite a bit, but I am not inclined to do anything about it, right
now.  Since, everything about google groups is ajaxy, this script uses
selenium and does things on the page, that one would do by hand.  It's
not something that I am proud of, but it does the job!

Machine Learning (or ML) offers the promise of having a computer
pour through your data and automatically extract or create the
information that you’re interested in. At least in theory. On closer
inspection machine learning is a loosely defined collection of
poorly explained statistical and algorithmic tricks that are magical
when they work and fail fantastically when they don’t. Acquiring the
needed skills for working with data safely is not easy. So we’ve
assembled a solid set of suggestions and resources on getting
started.

<p>
Between The Great Backlash Against Waterfall Design and The Supreme
Acceptance of Agile Development, something was lost. Don't get me
wrong, waterfall design takes things way too far. Huge systems
specified in minute detail end up being the WRONG systems specified
in minute detail. We were right to strike it down. But what took its
place is too far in the other direction. Now we have projects with
short, badly written, or entirely missing documentation. Some
projects don't even have a Readme!
</p>

<p>
This is not acceptable. There must be some middle ground between
reams of technical specifications and no specifications at all. And
in fact there is. That middle ground is the humble Readme.

The history of Goa is intrinsically linked to the many centuries of
Portuguese presence and rule. Before the arrival of the Portuguese,
most Goan houses were mostly made of mud and had a thatched
roof. They faced inwards towards a central courtyard and had small
windows, mostly devoid of ornaments.
</p>

<p>
The Portuguese arrived in Goa in 1510 and brought with them a host
of cultural and aesthetic influences from Europe and other
places. Goans who travelled abroad also returned with ideas and
influences from other countries that they incorporated into their
houses.

When others seem to be enjoying life, the black dog stands in the
way for a lot of people. If you're wondering WTF I'm talking about,
watch the video. And if you recognize any of this, maybe it's time
to think about taking some steps to look after yourself.

So if you donate those football tickets to some fans who were
willing to sit out in the snow for hours, you’d feel better about
staying in bed and watching the game on television.

<p>
Born of human error, continually generating copious heat, the
Elephant’s Foot is still melting into the base of the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant. If it hits ground water, it could trigger
another catastrophic explosion or leech radioactive material into
the water nearby residents drink. Long after bleeding from the core,
this unique piece of waste continues to be a testament to the
potential dangers of nuclear power. The Elephant’s Foot will be
there for centuries, sitting in the dark basement of a concrete and
steel sarcophagus, a symbol of one of humankind’s most powerful
tools gone awry.

I told you before that the purpose of mathematics is insight, but I
think I lied. Even more than that, the reason I do math is the
excitement and uncertainty of the chase. There is no joy in applying
a computer algorithm, but there is joy in unlocking the delicate
clockwork mechanism that makes a good math problem tick. And, in the
end, you just might learn something that nobody else in the world
knows!
</p>

<p>
… Oh, and by the way, I really don’t believe that honesty is merely
a wasted opportunity to cheat. I said that just for effect. Honest.

<a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201310/range_overlap_in_two_compares.html">Ned Batchelder: Range overlap in two compares</a>

<p>
His code used eight comparisons to check whether the endpoint of one of the ranges was contained within the other range. In Python it would look like this:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">overlap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">start1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">end1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">start2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">end2</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">"""Does the range (start1, end1) overlap with (start2, end2)?"""</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
	<span class="n">start1</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">start2</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">end1</span> <span class="ow">or</span>
	<span class="n">start1</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">end2</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">end1</span> <span class="ow">or</span>
	<span class="n">start2</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">start1</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">end2</span> <span class="ow">or</span>
	<span class="n">start2</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">end1</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">end2</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
I said you could do it in two comparisons rather than eight, but
could never remember the trick.

<p>
Cubr is a project I completed in three weeks at the end of my
introductory computer science class at CMU. The idea is simple: you
mix up a Rubik’s cube. You show the cube to your computer’s
webcam. Some magic happens, and your cube appears onscreen. Then,
the cube begins to solve itself, and all you have to do is follow
along and you will have solved your cube!

The Python packages in the official Ubuntu archives generally don't
go back all that far, but people might still need to develop and
test against these old Python interpreters. Felix Krull maintains a
PPA (package archive) of older Python versions that are easy to
install on Ubuntu.
