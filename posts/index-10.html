At home, my video would always show a silhouette in G+ and Skype, and
I always thought that this was because the lighting at home was not
sufficient.  At office, the video was decent.  But, moving to sit
right under the light also didn't help much.
</p>

<p>
Struggling with a bunch of tools like <code>v4lctl</code>, <code>guvcview</code> didn't
help. But, during these struggles I noticed that <code>cheese</code> would show
me bright and cheerful, while all the other programs showed my
silhouette.
</p>

<p>
I set out to "fake" the output of <code>cheese</code> as a video device that
skype and other programs could use. But, I didn't have to go all the
way.  I ended up using <a href="https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback/">v4l2loopback</a> to create a loopback video device,
and just using <code>gst-launch</code> to redirect video to that device, did the
trick!  Thanks gstreamer!  Thanks v4l2loopback! :)

<p>
Git can be accurately understood as a fairly simple functional data
structure. Instead of explaining Git in terms version control, we
can see the ability to do version control as an emergent property of
using that data structure. I think talking about Git in this manner
will more accurately convey the simplicity and power of Git better
than any comparisons with centralized version control systems can
accomplish.

So many books, so little time. With this in mind, the Amazon Books
editors set out to compile a list of 100 Books to Read in a
Lifetime. We had a few goals when we started out: We wanted the list
to cover all stages of a life (which is why you'll find children's
books in here), and we didn't want the list to feel like
homework. Of course, no such list can be comprehensive – our lives,
we hope, are long and varied – but we talked and argued and sifted
and argued some more and came up with a list, our list, of
favorites.

<p>
Any software project is a collaborative project. It has at least two
developers, the original developer and the original developer a few
weeks or months later when the train of thought has long left the
station. This later self needs to reestablish the context of a
particular piece of code each time a new bug occurs or a new feature
needs to be implemented.
</p>

<p>
Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can't
avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it to as
small as possible. Commit messages can do exactly that and as a
result, a commit message shows whether a developer is a good
collaborator.

<p>
It’s your fucking life. Only you can decide what to and what not to
do. If you’re going to be listening to every soul out there, you are
going to lose your individuality. I say do what you want. You want
to get married? Get married. You want to travel the world?
Travel. You want date older men? Date. You want to have Shiney
Ahuja’s lovechild? Have. The point is, be yourself. You can’t live
the world through someone’s else’s dreams.

For what it’s worth, my son’s going to have to put up with random
kisses, hair ruffles and hugs, whether he likes it or not. I’m gong
to sneak into his room and cuddle up with him in that tiny bed
because the world will swallow me in the morning and I’ll miss
seeing him.

<a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>

<p>
The best approach is more indirect: if you have the right sort of
background, good startup ideas will seem obvious to you. But even
then, not immediately. It takes time to come across situations where
you notice something missing. And often these gaps won't seem to be
ideas for companies, just things that would be interesting to
build. Which is why it's good to have the time and the inclination
to build things just because they're interesting.
</p>

<p>
Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it
sounds, that's the real recipe.

<p>
I like typing code. It says what it is. I even considered writing
graphs such as flow charts or database models in SVG once, but
that’s a bridge too far. What is pretty helpful though, is graphviz,
and the “dot” language.

<p>
In late 2012, Jody Ruth was stood on the edge of a cliff, looking to
end his life. Luckily, he came back, but many others don’t. Jody
found solace in writing, and wrote a hard-hitting blog called
‘Demons’ about what took him to the edge of the cliff, and what
happened whilst he was there.
