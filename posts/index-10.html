<p>
Born of human error, continually generating copious heat, the
Elephant’s Foot is still melting into the base of the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant. If it hits ground water, it could trigger
another catastrophic explosion or leech radioactive material into
the water nearby residents drink. Long after bleeding from the core,
this unique piece of waste continues to be a testament to the
potential dangers of nuclear power. The Elephant’s Foot will be
there for centuries, sitting in the dark basement of a concrete and
steel sarcophagus, a symbol of one of humankind’s most powerful
tools gone awry.

I told you before that the purpose of mathematics is insight, but I
think I lied. Even more than that, the reason I do math is the
excitement and uncertainty of the chase. There is no joy in applying
a computer algorithm, but there is joy in unlocking the delicate
clockwork mechanism that makes a good math problem tick. And, in the
end, you just might learn something that nobody else in the world
knows!
</p>

<p>
… Oh, and by the way, I really don’t believe that honesty is merely
a wasted opportunity to cheat. I said that just for effect. Honest.

His code used eight comparisons to check whether the endpoint of one of the ranges was contained within the other range. In Python it would look like this:

Cubr is a project I completed in three weeks at the end of my

mix up a Rubik’s cube. You show the cube to your computer’s
webcam. Some magic happens, and your cube appears onscreen. Then,
the cube begins to solve itself, and all you have to do is follow
along and you will have solved your cube!

not special. You're another completely inexperienced young person
who doesn't have all that much to offer yet. You can become
special by working really hard for a long time.

<li>Ignore everyone else. Other people's grass seeming greener is no
new concept, but in today's image crafting world, other people's
grass looks like a glorious meadow. The truth is that everyone
else is just as indecisive, self-doubting, and frustrated as you
are, and if you just do your thing, you'll never have any reason
to envy others.

<p>
Python’s standard logging package is a really wonderful thing, but
unfortunately some of its key ideas aren’t clearly documented in a
large enough point font.

<p>
The engineering metaphor has had its time in the sun, and maybe it
even used to be accurate, but now it really only serves to help
non-technical people have unrealistic expectations about how
software gets built.

<p>
When Craig Lewis aged 55 had been diagnosed with a heart disease so
intricate not even a pacemaker could save him, Texan doctors had to
think outside of the box.
</p>

<p>
Outstandingly, they developed a revolutionary concept where by they
install a device that keeps his blood in continuous flow…without a
pulse.
</p>

<p>
Within a day of surgery Craig was up and speaking to doctors and now
lives fully functioning without a heart. Who said science was
boring?
