- I happily let myself get distracted from all the math!  I had seen a [[https://twitter.com/ballingt/status/483394809411825665][tweet]] by
  Tom during the weekend, asking if there was any package that let users
  inspect C sources of builtin modules like ruby's [[https://github.com/pry/pry-doc/][pry-doc]]
- I spent the morning playing around with pry-doc, reading its code, etc.
- The latter part of the day was spent pairing with Tom, and figuring out what
  needs to be done to write a first cut version of something like this.  Ugly
  regexes, FTW! I have something that works for most of the stuff, it seems!
- I also attended an interesting talk about Bit-torrent clients by an alum.
