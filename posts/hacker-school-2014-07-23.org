* Shairplay and WS2801

- Kyle mounted the LEDs onto a cardboard, and packaged it to look cool.

- We thought we were done with the project, until we found out we weren't!  The
  LEDs all lighted up correctly, when we played the audio from a file on disk,
  but streaming messed something up!  Only the first few columns lighted up,
  when we were listening on the stream.

- We spent the whole evening trying to debug the issue, and eliminated quite a
  few hypothesis, but weren't able to fix it, yet.

* Miscellaneous

- rntz live coded a parser for us yesterday, and I learnt a few things about
  parsers.  I'm glad I went to the discussion/talk.

- I started working through the videos of Anatomy of Matplotlib, and hope to
  get new insights into how it works.

* Today

- Today will be spent mostly trying to get streaming audio working.

- I feel like debugging this, will take my understanding of the
  hardware-software interface to a new level.
