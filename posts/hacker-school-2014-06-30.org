- During the weekend, I read up a lot about HMMs and related stuff.
- During the day, I tried to start writing code for different parts of the
  pipeline, and ended up reading about Mel frequency cepstrum related stuff,

- The day ended with a talk by Jesse at EBay, titled [[http://emptysqua.re/blog/write-an-excellent-programming-blog/][Write an Excellent

  announced, and so, most of the content was known, but the Q&A session had
  some interesting suggestions on how to improve your actual writing.
