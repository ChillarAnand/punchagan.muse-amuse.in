After a short break, I'm back to blogging!
A few things have changed meanwhile. A lot haven't.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Noetic Nought shall now be called Rustic Reverie.
</li>

<li>The Blogs I read page is now manually populated. More pages might be
coming soon.
</li>

<li>My web presence has almost been reduced to just this blog. I hope to
be blogging more often this time around. I guess I'll have shorter
and more frequent posts. "Release early, Release often."
</li>

<li>I've been inspired by Sacha Chua and her wonderful blog. She puts up
anything that -
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>she may look up in future.
</li>
<li>could be remotely useful to anybody on this planet.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I like her idea of "thinking of writing as sketching". "Keep
repeating yourself, until the core message floats to the top". It
feels similar to the idea - "Release early, Release often."
</p>
</li>

<li>Also, Thanks to Madhu and Vattam who set an impossibly high standard
by having their resumes and letters of recommendations and other
"personal" stuff on version control on public repositories.
</li>

<li>All my posts will be made from org2blog - a little org-mode based
client that I hacked up. Emacs and Org-mode all the way! This is the
first post by me (and probably anybody) from org2blog!

    <p>
I want to be a part of the "reader-space" of blogs or web-sites
rather than a part of the Google-reader ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
As most of my readers know, I'm big on Google Reader (and I have a
reputation for that!). I'm a part of a wonderful ecosystem and get
to look-at or read a lot of interesting stuff. I get a lot of
variety, stuff that I wouldn't normally have come across. It keeps
me from staying in a tiny well, reading the same kind of stuff,
over and over again. I also like the fact that it acts as an
archival system for me. I can go back and read posts, which don't
exist on the web, anymore.
</p>

<p>
But, I have a problem with this ecosystem. It's killing the the
communities around the blogs or sites, themselves. The reader
count may have gone up, but the discussion and activity of the
community on the blogs is going down; at least on the blogs I look
at. Blogs are rather dead, these days. But, when one's following
over 200 blogs, you can't expect much better. It is difficult to
keep up with all of them; even the ones that one kept up well
with, before. People stop going back to the comments; stop
participating in the discussion.
</p>

<p>
Do you agree? Do you think it'll help it feed readers keep track
of the comments and updates? Or is the only way to cut down on
feed-reading and getting back to the old exciting way of checking
out blogs? I recall an old quote I read - If it's not worth
remembering, it's not worth reading.
</p>

<p>
<b>UPDATE:</b> I wasn't talking of my blog or comments here, in
 particular (if that's not already clear). I was talking of blogs,
 that I read regularly, blogs of people I know well (including
 mine). But then, there are blogs, that have over 1000 comments on
 a single post, too. Should the above quote could be changed to
 read - "If it's not worth reading, it's not worth remembering." ?

A Rocking.. err.. Pebbling.. err.. Pedaling Trip. IIT Bombay,
Powai to the Gateway of India. I simply loved it!
</p>

<p>
The original plan was to land somewhere near Chowpatty beach, but
I had some useless landmarks and I got lost. I was not too
particular about going to a particular place, so didn't try too
hard to stay on track and was happy to end up at the
Gateway. Thanks to the Mumbai local, I don't know the road
routes. But, again thanks to the Mumbai local, I have a general
idea of the direction.
</p>

<p>
I woke up a bit later than scheduled, but almost made up for the
delay until I reach my cycle to find the rear tyre fully flat. I
quickly diagnosed the problem to be with the valve. But, I had no
spare valve, unless, I "borrow" it from a cycle near-by. I
replaced my valve with Vattam's cycle's and was good to go!
</p>

<p>
I didn't have a big enough water bottle, and carried along only
half a litre after drinking one half litre. The first half hour
was a breeze; possibly the best part of the whole ride. High on
energy and enthu. Then, my groin/ass started to hurt a bit. I
pulled out my music player to drown the pain in music. This kinda
worked and I pulled on pretty well until King's circle. That's
when I emptied all the water I had. I hoped to find water along
the way, if I badly needed it.
</p>

<p>
Sometime later, I had to take a right turn, but I never knew
where. I didn't bother to ask anyone, nor did I look at the
landmarks I had scribbled down. I was happy to go straight
ahead. :)
</p>

<p>
And by the time I reached CST/Fort, I did need water; badly
enough. I stopped at the next open shop (that was not a
pan-ki-dukaan) and got myself some Nimbu paani and a litre of
water (for future).
</p>

<p>
The Gateway of India was just 10 minutes away from here.  Loitered
around there, for about 40 minutes. There were a lot of Policemen
all over the place. After about 5 minutes of me reaching there,
they cleared the whole area right next to the Gateway of India. I
don't know why. (Also, all along the way, there were a lot of men
in Khaaki. I guess there's some rally or some such thing
scheduled)
</p>

<p>
On the return, I lost my way almost immediately after
starting. There was a one way road that I avoided and took the
adjacent road but ended up going off-track. I had some doubts
about this but they weren't confirmed until I reached Mahalaxmi
station! But there, a Taxi driver gave me rough guidelines to get
back on my track. I turned back and soon was "back-on-track".
</p>

<p>
I'd planned to have breakfast at Idli house, as soon as I saw it
during my onward journey. So, I went directly to Idli house, and
treated myself to a Rava idli and some wonderful Kaapi. The waiter
got tipped well, too. ;)
</p>

<p>
From Matunga, back to IIT was straight forward; except for the
growing traffic and the PITA (literally). The traffic signals were
a bit annoying, too.
</p>

<p>
On the whole was an awesome trip! I loved it. Hope to go on more
such rides. But, I guess I'll head north-ward, the next time.
</p>

<p>
By the way, it was approx. 60kms on the whole and took me 5 hours
(including the time I spent at the Gateway of India) with about 3
hours 40 mins of pedaling.. err.. rocking. :D

My first Cricket match in a stadium. I regret that it was a
T-20. I'm happy, though, to have got the darshan of bhaiyya a.k.a
Sachin. Also, I did enjoy the energy of being in a stadium.
</p>

<p>
I was actually intent on watching MI vs. RR, but, junta voted in
favor of the Opening Ceremony. It was a grandiloquent let-down,
but for the fireworks. There was nothing really spectacular about
the ceremony. A mediocre performance… With the kind of money
they have at hand, and have spent, I really would've liked
something better.
</p>

<p>
The match. DC vs. KKR. DC lost a game that it could've comfortably
won. It would've been a decent match to watch, if not for the
stupid DJ-ing. The game looked so different from what I'm used to
seeing on the TV. [The only thing that was exactly as I saw in TV
was, the crowd drooling at the cheer girls.]
</p>

<p>
I was shocked by the amount of disturbance a player has to
overcome, while playing. Has the "gentle-man's" game turned into a
"super-man's" game? Between each and every ball, the DJ is either
shouting some incomprehensible inanities or playing some crazy
"number" at the highest volume. The batsmen almost had to wait for
him to shut up, before each ball. Can someone tell me if these are
perks that the third version brings with it, or if I was happily
ignorant, thanks to the TV watching? The heart-beat sound in the
final overs was ridiculously annoying. I was looking forward to
one of the batsmen throwing his bat at the DJ.
</p>

<p>
Also, it's a big joke to call this ground a "home" for DC. It was
nothing close to a home ground, in terms of the crowd. I don't see
Cuttack being any more homely, especially with the Kalinga Sena
already passing crazy orders to the cricketers. DC will have to
play exceedingly well to end-up anywhere near the top.  But,
amidst all this, I'm happy for the people of AP. With a huge
electric-power crisis looming ahead, they have already saved (or
produced) power worth 7 IPL matches!
</p>

<p>
Also, this is the end of IPL v3 for me. I'm done with cricket for
this season.

This post is my attempt to start a travelogue. I hope to capture
the "All India Tour" phase of my life (as people have started to
call it).  I'll try to keep these posts from becoming travel
guides. There are loads of them and I surely don't need to
increment count.
</p>

<p>
This post is after a trip to Kanpur, Agra and Sikri.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Trains are never on Time. The delay increases exponentially with
your distance from the sourthern most tip of the country. Also,
the confidence of the aam admi in this delay is proportional to
the distance. Any delay less than an hour wasn't considered to
be a delay. Thanks to the fog, low visibility.
</li>
<li>If you want to travel around India, all you need is an
SLR. Additionally, if you are not of Indian origin, you'll need
the "India" guide. I got bored of seeing people poring over the
pages of that "blue" India book or madly clicking away on their
SLRs.
</li>
<li>Whether or not you get food or water on a train, you are assured
of enough "chilled" air from the slit under your window. Come
what may, you shall not be deprived of this service.
</li>
<li>The trust of a person in you is inversely proportional to the
difference between your ages. It is inversely proportional to
the 2.718th power of the difference if you are aged between 20
and 25. I only vaguely remember what the TTE told me in my
sleep, while paying the fine for not carrying a print out of our
e-ticket; but, it really was something sick and senseless.
</li>
<li>The chill at a place, on the day you reach, is inversely
proportional to how much people have scared/warned you. On the
rest of the days, it is proportional to the square of the warm
clothing you have on you. I thoroughly enjoyed the chill of
Kanpur. Wonderful! The infrastructure, too good! Never expected
a 50 year old campus to be so Awesome. [They have an air-strip
too!]
</li>
<li>The thrill of having an ice-cream is proportional to the square
of difference between the ambient temperature and the standard
room temperature.
</li>
<li>Don't ever think of celebrating your escape, without the Aalu
encounter. Welcome to the land of Alu addicted men. You shall,
surely, have your share. If not anything else, you shall be
serverd a Capsicum or Brinjal stuffed with Aalu. Also, the
quality and availability of leather seems to be proportional to
the addiction to Aalu.
</li>
<li>"hawker time" - the time you spend being followed by hawkers
trying to convince you to buy whatever they
have. "firang-ness" - difficult to predict; a parameter that
depends on the amount of branded stuff on you, stylishness of
your winter wear and other unknown variableness. Your hawker
time is proportional to (firang-ness) \* abs(time of day in 24
hr clock - 1400) [when, 900 &lt; time &lt; 1800] I understand, that,
they need to make ends meet; each day of their lives. I got
followed a lot. I can't help observing. Sometimes, enjoyed being
followed too.
</li>
</ul>

The Taj. Simply Awe-Inspiring. As Madhu put it, "the longer you
keep watching it, the more it's beauty overwhelms you". But, I
still think, the first time is the best time to see it. It's
simply mind blowing when you get the first glimpse, after entering
from the West gate.

It's time to stop writing when all you can see is proportionality
between totally unrelated things.  Here are a few pics

Shantanu and I conducted a workshop on Scipy at GNUnify '10. It
was intended to be an introduction to Scipy and Numpy through
Image processing. We expected an audience which was python
literate. But GNUnify's schedule wasn't too favorable for us. Ours
was the first talk scheduled and we ended up getting people who
only "heard" of Python, the language.
</p>

<p>
We had planned quite a bit of stuff expecting a python literate
audience. But unfortunately, we had to start almost from scratch
and couldn't do all of what we planned. Still, the workshop wasn't
too bad. Nobody left mid-way during the 2 hour workshop; nobody
was dozing either.  I would have liked my first talk at a FOSS
event to be better, though.

Slides and Images that we used.  Shantanu's post on the talk is

Like most bloggers, I keep looking at my blogs hits once in a
while. (Sometimes inspires to write better; and more often.) The
post that gets most hits these days is my post on mailman,
postfix, et al. But the search term that's increasingly bringing
people to my blog is "punchagan".
</p>

<p>
This scares me. What makes people search for me? What makes people
search more often these days? Why am I scared?
</p>

<p>
Why do people use monikers or online identities? I started off
with the idea of anonymity and privacy; keeping my online identify
separate from my real one. But it, obviously, is a folly to have
you email id with the same handle. Now, almost anybody who knows
me, also knows my online handle. They can find me anywhere and
everywhere with just a few keystrokes (and Google). Also, the
uniqueness of my handle doesn't help one bit. Any search returns
over 90% relevant results.
</p>

<p>
Is it time to get lost in the crowd with a new handle? ;) Probably
not. I don't have much to hide under the covers. Let the world see
– who I am, who I have been; where I am, where I have been.
</p>

<p>
Peace.
