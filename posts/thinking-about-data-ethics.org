Earlier this month, a researcher made a dataset containing the profiles of about
70,000 users public. He didn't really see a problem in doing this because he
felt he was only presenting [[https://twitter.com/KirkegaardEmil/status/730449904909324289][already publicly available]] data in a more usable
form. was only presenting it in a more usable form.

Yesterday, I came across this quote in the very first chapter of [[https://twitter.com/allendowney][Allen Downey]]'s
book [[http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html][Think Stats]] which I liked a lot, and reminded me of this incident.

I hadn't looked at the OKCupid data release and the discussion around it much,
but I went back and read [[andhttps://points.datasociety.net/okcupid-data-release-fiasco-ba0388348cd#.u8xxlkqsv][this article]] by a social media researcher who thinks a
lot about these things. 

She puts forth a lot of interesting ideas to think about ethics. Some things
that stood out to me are:

- Ask yourself how the person whose data you are using feels about the data.
- Taking a 'what if' impact approach to thinking about data and ethics.

Also, you needn't really call yourself a researcher to be actually doing
experiments with (or [[http://www.npr.org/2016/05/17/478266839/this-is-your-brain-on-uber][analyzing]]) "big-data" and discovering and putting out facts
that have an impact -- however big or small. You should really go read the
article, whether or not you are a researcher using data.

Incidentally, there is a meet-up on [[http://www.meetup.com/DataKind-Bangalore/events/231310093/][Data Ethics]] this weekend in Bangalore. I'm
excited to learn and think more about this, and talk to others who care.
