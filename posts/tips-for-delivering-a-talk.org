Write your post here.

- You should repeat the question (summarized) before answering so others in the
  audience and those watching the video will know what you're answering.
- Don't highlight your code. Highlight the parts that you want your audience to
  focus on
- Toy examples/problems may not be interesting. Present real use cases. The
  documentation usually ships with the toy examples!
