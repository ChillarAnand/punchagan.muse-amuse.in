  The engineering metaphor has had its time in the sun, and maybe it
  even used to be accurate, but now it really only serves to help
  non-technical people have unrealistic expectations about how
  software gets built.

  I am a Software Gardener.

  So are you.

  When Craig Lewis aged 55 had been diagnosed with a heart disease so
  intricate not even a pacemaker could save him, Texan doctors had to
  think outside of the box.

  Outstandingly, they developed a revolutionary concept where by they
  install a device that keeps his blood in continuous flowâ€¦without a
  pulse.

  Within a day of surgery Craig was up and speaking to doctors and now
  lives fully functioning without a heart. Who said science was
  boring?
