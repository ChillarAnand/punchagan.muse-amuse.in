- The Apprenticeship patterns book is very interesting!  I shall
  continue to read it and start create daily/weekly rituals from the
  actions prescribed in the book!
- I was reading [[http://blogs.collab.net/git/protect-git-history#.U6fixh-caV4][this post]] on ~git gc~, ~reflog~, etc. and wanted to
  see what the default values were for some of the configurable
  variables.  But, the git config command didn't help.  Developer/code
  defaults are also a part of the "config" system, and any tools to
  inspect config variables should display them, if no other values
  have been set explicitly!
- "If experience is built upon failure as much as success, then you
  need a more or less private space where you can seek out failure."
