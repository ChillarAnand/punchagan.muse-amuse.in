- Amber [[http://www.subsymbol.org/2014/06/hacker-school-tuesday-june-17th-2014.html][talked about]] "exploring only until the current task is done"
  and moving on, which is could really be a lost opportunity to learn
  something new and gain a better understanding of the system I am
  working with.
- Having something (anything not directly related to the current
  project I'm working on) scheduled for later in the day, doesn't seem
  to do me much good. I feel distracted for quite a long period before
  the scheduled time.
- Abstractions and layers were talked about in the second exercise on
  Applicatives... Layering, FTW!
- I spent about an hour or so in the afternoon reading the paper, [[https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gkrichar/papers/onward2013-wuerthinger-truffle.pdf][One
  VM to rule them all]].  It talked about Truffle: an API to implement
  an AST parser for any language and Graal: a JIT compiler for the
  ASTs.  Later in the day, I also went to the [[http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/events/178049922/][Papers we love]] meetup.
  The presentation and the talks were quite interesting!
- I also started looking at [[http://elm-lang.org][Elm]] and playing with it.
