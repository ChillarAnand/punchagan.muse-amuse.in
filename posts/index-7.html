exercise, and I built one that is not persistent, in the two hours.  I worked
on a not so important problem of having sorted query parameters, instead of
the more important problem of having a persistent server.  Anyway, I should
be building something that works, first, before trying to solve the more
interesting problems.  At least on Fridays.

<li>I like how some of the people here are taking check-ins so seriously.  A
bunch of people posted messages on Zulip, informing that they would not be
able to make it to check-ins, and seemed quite sorry about it.
</li>
<li>Check-ins are indeed useful.  At the end of every day, I review my work
wondering what I did, and sometimes end up pushing myself harder, to have
something reasonable to talk about during the check-ins!
</li>
<li>Yesterday, I read up about FFTs and ended up playing around with <code>fft</code> in
<code>scipy</code>, and played around with audacity, etc.  Nothing concrete, really.
</li>
<li>There was a "goals" workshop by Stacey, where she talked about how to get the
most out of this batch of Hacker School, and then we split into groups of 3,
and presented our goal-statements to each other, and gave our impressions of
each others' goals.
</li>
<li>I didn't really have a goal, but the exercise seemed to help, anyway.
</li>
<li>Also, I think it is making me nervous to treat Hacker School as
super-important.  It is important to make the best use of every hour, every
minute here, but at the same time, I shouldn't be constantly worrying about
whether or not, whatever I'm doing is the best use of my time here.
</li>
<li>I think I would like to form some good habits, and make a few good friends,
more than finish projects and build something uber-cool.  Of course, it would
be great to build awesome stuff (and may be the only reasonable way to form
habits, and make friends) but I shouldn't worry too much about time running
out. Never Graduate!

<li>I worked for the whole day on implementing <i>an algorithm</i> to analyze a
cipher text, and guess the substitution cipher used.  The algorithm
was pretty straight forward, and I had it "mostly" working, in a
couple of hours.
</li>
<li>I then began to refactor it, and found that there was what looked
like a bug, and I "fixed" it mindlessly.  I was essentially trying
to swap 2 rows, and columns of a pandas data frame.  I had a
data-frame <code>D</code> and its copy <code>D_</code>.  I was trying to swap 2 rows and
columns of <code>D_</code>.  I found that the code was initially using the data
from <code>D</code> to do the swap.  To fix it, I checked if tuple unpacking
did the right thing.  It looked like it did.  So, I used something
like <code>_D['a'], D_['b'] = D_['b'], D_['a']</code>.  Essentially, changed <code>D</code>
on the right hand side to <code>D_</code>.  I thought I had tested this on the
terminal, but after hours of debugging (along with fixing another
minor issue), I later found out that the tuple unpacking doesn't
work and the swapped rows and columns actually become equal!  I had
suspected this initially, and had "tested" this manually, I
thought.  These are the kinds of things that should have tests for,
I think.  It wouldn't have taken me too long to write a test, and I
could have been totally sure that it works!  (I was manually reading
off values in the array, and probably messed up somewhere)

<p>
FWIW, the code now reads <code>_D['a'], D_['b'] = D_['b'].copy(),
  D_['a'].copy()</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>The algo seems to need about 1000 characters to get past the 90%
accuracy mark.  I could probably tweak it a little to perform
better, but I'm going to leave it here, for now, and move on to the
signal processing parts.  I'm not totally sure how the signal
processing would work, and whether we could actually map back the
keystrokes to a substitution cipher enciphered text.
</li>
<li>If required, the tweaks could be -
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use trigrams instead of bigrams
</li>
<li>Add a degree of dictionary look-ups: May be something like,
look-up all the deciphered words, and try not swapping the
characters that appear in most of the words that are in the
dictionary.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This paper is 20 years old, and there would surely be work by others
building on top of this, or doing it totally differently.

<li>The Apprenticeship patterns book is very interesting!  I shall
continue to read it and start create daily/weekly rituals from the
actions prescribed in the book!

<li>I was reading <a href="http://blogs.collab.net/git/protect-git-history#.U6fixh-caV4">this post</a> on <code>git gc</code>, <code>reflog</code>, etc. and wanted to
see what the default values were for some of the configurable
variables.  But, the git config command didn't help.  Developer/code
defaults are also a part of the "config" system, and any tools to
inspect config variables should display them, if no other values
have been set explicitly!

<li>Most of the day was spent with Git.  In the morning, I learned that
setting <code>push.default</code> to <code>nothing</code> will prevent pushing any
branches without specifying explicitly which branch I want to push.

<li>Also, later in the day, Alan gave a presentation mapping the
internals of git to the commands, trying to give everyone a better
mental model of Git.

<li>I spent some time trying to get <code>jedi</code> integration for <code>emacs</code>. It
should've worked out of the box, but I'm not sure the ELPA
repositories have proper dependency/version management.  Seems to be
the problem, everywhere!  Dependencies of a package get updated, and
the package starts acting up…

<li>Chaitu sent me a link about solving mazes using Finite Automata, and
I spent some time trying to write a simple solver, and compare it
with Nava's breadth first search.  But, it looks like we broke her
code during the refactor.  I may get back to this, at some point.

implement a simple version of the NTP protocol.  The algorithm it

<li>I spent most of Saturday, thinking about what I should be doing for
the next few weeks, and what I really want to get out of Hacker
School.
</li>
<li>I had a good discussion with Naren about things that he works on,
and the kind of things that he sees as hard, what kind of things
interest me, and what I want to do post Hacker School.  I always
knew, I didn't really have an area of expertise or an area that I'm
super interested in, where I want to work.  This discussion only was
a verbalizing of those thoughts.
</li>
<li>I am not sure, I am very happy with the way I have been learning
Haskell.  The UPenn course has been reasonably good with the
exercises provided, and I have been learning through "pseudo"
projects.  But, I'm wondering if I should pick up a more concrete
project.
</li>
<li>I played around a little bit with Elm and started something to try
and write <a href="https://github.com/huckerdom/layout">Layout</a> using Elm.
</li>
<li>I tried cleaning up the phonebook problem from Friday. It works, but
can definitely be improved with some help from a more experienced
Haskeller.

    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <ul class="org-ul">
<li>I finished parts of the phonebook task today.  The code looks ugly,
and very un-haskelly.  I asked for feedback on it, but I guess its
just too ugly for anyone to take the time out to comment on it, and
help me improve it.
</li>
<li>I also tried to read up about Monads, and worked through exercises
from a few different places.  I haven't yet finished the exercises
in Chapter 12 of the UPenn course.  I just looked at them today, and
they seem like a complete bouncer at first glance.
</li>
<li>I went on a really long walk with Naren, and food-hopped with him
while he was telling me stories about the various places he worked
at and the kinds of things he has been working on, and things he
liked and disliked about them.  It has been a good weekend to spend
with Naren!
</li>
<li>Also, the long walk and talking to Chaitu cleared my head a bit, and
I decided to pause the Haskell tutorials and learning for the next
couple of weeks.  I don't really have a project that needs me to
learn Haskell, right now.  I should stick to project and need based
learning, which I enjoy the most.
</li>
<li>Right now, I feel like working on an key stroke acoustic emanation
based key-logger.  Just before applying to Hacker School, I came
across the idea of side-channel attacks, and it sounded pretty
exciting.  I don't intend to snoop onto anybody, but the project
seems to be challenging enough, and I will have quite a bit to learn
about. It will involve signal processing, and learning – both areas
that I have seemed interesting to me for long, but I haven't really
done anything in them.  I plan to work on the idea for a couple of
weeks, and review my progress and chart my future course. The
problem appears to have 2 parts to it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Processing audio, and extracting key-strokes from it.
</li>
<li>Identifying the text, based on a sequence of key-strokes. Though,
in reality each press of a key may not sound the same, for a start
assuming we are able to accurately get a sequence of key-strokes,
the problem would reduce to solving a simple substitution cipher.
I plan to start with this, tomorrow.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, I plan to hang out a lot more with Hacker Schoolers, and let
myself be distracted a lot more by random discussions and
activities, than I have allowed myself to be, in the past few weeks.
I should be writing as much code as I can, while I'm here.  But, I
should also be rubbing elbows with the awesome folks, which I will
only be able to virtually, once I'm out of here.
</li>
<li>Thanks to Amber, I also came across this interesting looking book
called <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813">Apprenticeship patterns</a>.  I plan to read it over the next
week or two.
</li>
<li>I haven't been playing almost any Ultimate here. I atleast need to
work out a conditioning and throwing practice schedule and start
working on it, early next week.  Tomorrow won't work since it's 5am
and I'm still awake!
</li>
<li>I also probably need to get enough sleep!
</li>
<li>Looking forward to the next couple of weeks!

I was trying to pair on writing a simple app that uses Hacker
School's OAuth2 API, and hit a roadblock on the first step of
requesting an authorization from the user.  Once the user authorized
my app, I would see an error that said, "The authorization server
does not support this response type".  I was using a client library
that I had <a href="https://github.com/litl/rauth">used before</a>, and the server was using a what seemed like
a <a href="https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper">popular implementation</a> for ruby on rails.  Getting weird errors is
not done!
</p>

<p>
I have used OAuth2 based authentication <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/statiki/blob/master/statiki.py#L49">before</a>, but the thought of
using it always makes me a little nervous, just because
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I don't understand it very well.
</li>
<li>Like almost everything else, there seem to be so many libraries
for doing this in Python, and I'm never sure which one to use, or
which one I used the last time around.  Not understanding the
protocol also doesn't let me debug anything that comes up.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
To fix this, I set about to read and understand the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth2 protocol</a>.
This blog post is an attempt to record it for future reference, and
possibly act as a reference for others.

<h2 id="sec-2">Why OAuth</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
OAuth is simply a way for an end-user to allow third parties to use
protected data, without sharing the user's credentials with the
third-party.
</p>

<p>
For example, an end-user (Jane) can grant a printing service
(Printo) access to her protected photos stored at a photo-sharing
service (Picasa), without sharing her username and password with the
printing service.  Instead, she authenticates directly with a server
trusted by the photo-sharing service, which issues the printing
service delegation-specific credentials. (example from the OAuth 2.0
spec)

The flow occurs through a sequence of user actions, client requests
and user-agent (browser) redirects.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(A) Printo asks Jane to allow using Picasa Data. The request can
be sent directly to Jane, but is usually routed via
Picasa/Google.
</li>

<li>(B) Printo gets back an authorization grant, which is a
credential representing Jane's authorization or approval.  The
type of the actual grant credential depends on the type of
request that Printo used.
</li>

<li>(C, D) Printo gets back to Google with the credentials it obtained
in the previous step and obtains a token that it can use to talk
with Picasa.
</li>

<li>(E, F) Printo asks for the desired photo with the token it
obtained previously, and Picasa gives back the photo to print.
Jane gets her framed photo!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But before any of this happens, the client needs to register with
the authorization server and obtain a <code>client_id</code> and
<code>client_secret</code>, that will be used to identify the client making
the requests.

<h2 id="sec-4">Pythonized "authorization code" work-flow.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The OAuth2 spec allows the authorization request/grant to be of 4
different types.  It also allows some flexibility in the token
type.
</p>

<p>
In my experience, the most common work-flow seems to be using an
<i>authorization code</i> as an authorization grant, and using a <i>Bearer</i>
type token.  This work-flow is explained in the diagram below (taken
from the spec document).  This diagram zooms in, onto the steps A-D
in the diagram above.

<h2 id="sec-5">Conclusion</h2>

<p>
I think, I understand the OAuth2 spec a lot better now, and hope
that this will help others understand it, too.  And more
importantly, I won't get nervous when I have to add it to my
projects.
</p>

<p>
Also, <a href="https://github.com/idan/oauthlib">oauthlib</a> for Python seems to be a pretty thorough
implementation of the spec, and <a href="https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib">requests-oauthlib</a> seems to wrap it
for use with requests.  I think I'm going to use this in my future
projects.
