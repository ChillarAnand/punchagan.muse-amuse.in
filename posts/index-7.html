<li>I pushed the code onto <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/cinspect">github</a> to let Allison and Tom review it, and Tom was
quite excited by the idea of having it.
</li>
<li>I added a startup script in IPython, to monkey-patch it to use my code for
introspection.
</li>
<li>Having never written a C-extension, I read up the Python docs on <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html">writing C

<li>I got distracted trying to add a hack to Hacker School's <a href="https://github.com/sursh/blaggregator">blaggregator</a>, to
enable posting to different channels on zulip.
</li>
<li>I learnt a few things about Django.  Commented out references to views that
don't exists breaks templating.  Formsets didn't seem very convenient to use,
for editing data showing the user only partial forms.
</li>
<li>I played around with Clang for a bit, to try and use libclang to parse the C
code for inspection, instead of writing one myself.  It sometimes feels like
an overkill, but it feels like it'll make the whole code more robust.  I'm
not sure.  I'll need to play around for a bit more to decide.
</li>
<li>I also finally got around to fix the resolution of my tty shells.  I was in a
bus, and wanted my laptop's battery to last longer, and decided to use a tty
shell with just emacs running. But, the resolution sucked.  So, I
fixed. Essentially it involved removing a blacklist file that an old version
of Nvidia drivers left behind in
<code>/usr/share/grub-gfxpayload-lists/blacklist/</code> and setting
<code>GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080</code> in <code>/etc/default/grub</code>.

<li>Later in the evening I also bought the domain <code>octo.cat</code>, given there were a
bunch of people buying cat domains, and talking about it on Zulip!

<li>This Friday we worked on building our own URL shorteners.  It was a fun
exercise, and I built one that is not persistent, in the two hours.  I worked
on a not so important problem of having sorted query parameters, instead of
the more important problem of having a persistent server.  Anyway, I should
be building something that works, first, before trying to solve the more
interesting problems.  At least on Fridays.

<li>I like how some of the people here are taking check-ins so seriously.  A
bunch of people posted messages on Zulip, informing that they would not be
able to make it to check-ins, and seemed quite sorry about it.
</li>
<li>Check-ins are indeed useful.  At the end of every day, I review my work
wondering what I did, and sometimes end up pushing myself harder, to have
something reasonable to talk about during the check-ins!
</li>
<li>Yesterday, I read up about FFTs and ended up playing around with <code>fft</code> in
<code>scipy</code>, and played around with audacity, etc.  Nothing concrete, really.
</li>
<li>There was a "goals" workshop by Stacey, where she talked about how to get the
most out of this batch of Hacker School, and then we split into groups of 3,
and presented our goal-statements to each other, and gave our impressions of
each others' goals.
</li>
<li>I didn't really have a goal, but the exercise seemed to help, anyway.
</li>
<li>Also, I think it is making me nervous to treat Hacker School as
super-important.  It is important to make the best use of every hour, every
minute here, but at the same time, I shouldn't be constantly worrying about
whether or not, whatever I'm doing is the best use of my time here.
</li>
<li>I think I would like to form some good habits, and make a few good friends,
more than finish projects and build something uber-cool.  Of course, it would
be great to build awesome stuff (and may be the only reasonable way to form
habits, and make friends) but I shouldn't worry too much about time running
out. Never Graduate!

<li>I worked for the whole day on implementing <i>an algorithm</i> to analyze a
cipher text, and guess the substitution cipher used.  The algorithm
was pretty straight forward, and I had it "mostly" working, in a
couple of hours.
</li>
<li>I then began to refactor it, and found that there was what looked
like a bug, and I "fixed" it mindlessly.  I was essentially trying
to swap 2 rows, and columns of a pandas data frame.  I had a
data-frame <code>D</code> and its copy <code>D_</code>.  I was trying to swap 2 rows and
columns of <code>D_</code>.  I found that the code was initially using the data
from <code>D</code> to do the swap.  To fix it, I checked if tuple unpacking
did the right thing.  It looked like it did.  So, I used something
like <code>_D['a'], D_['b'] = D_['b'], D_['a']</code>.  Essentially, changed <code>D</code>
on the right hand side to <code>D_</code>.  I thought I had tested this on the
terminal, but after hours of debugging (along with fixing another
minor issue), I later found out that the tuple unpacking doesn't
work and the swapped rows and columns actually become equal!  I had
suspected this initially, and had "tested" this manually, I
thought.  These are the kinds of things that should have tests for,
I think.  It wouldn't have taken me too long to write a test, and I
could have been totally sure that it works!  (I was manually reading
off values in the array, and probably messed up somewhere)

<p>
FWIW, the code now reads <code>_D['a'], D_['b'] = D_['b'].copy(),
  D_['a'].copy()</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>The algo seems to need about 1000 characters to get past the 90%
accuracy mark.  I could probably tweak it a little to perform
better, but I'm going to leave it here, for now, and move on to the
signal processing parts.  I'm not totally sure how the signal
processing would work, and whether we could actually map back the
keystrokes to a substitution cipher enciphered text.
</li>
<li>If required, the tweaks could be -
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use trigrams instead of bigrams
</li>
<li>Add a degree of dictionary look-ups: May be something like,
look-up all the deciphered words, and try not swapping the
characters that appear in most of the words that are in the
dictionary.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This paper is 20 years old, and there would surely be work by others
building on top of this, or doing it totally differently.

<li>The Apprenticeship patterns book is very interesting!  I shall
continue to read it and start create daily/weekly rituals from the
actions prescribed in the book!
</li>
<li>I was reading <a href="http://blogs.collab.net/git/protect-git-history#.U6fixh-caV4">this post</a> on <code>git gc</code>, <code>reflog</code>, etc. and wanted to
see what the default values were for some of the configurable
variables.  But, the git config command didn't help.  Developer/code
defaults are also a part of the "config" system, and any tools to
inspect config variables should display them, if no other values
have been set explicitly!
</li>
<li>"If experience is built upon failure as much as success, then you
need a more or less private space where you can seek out failure."
– Apprenticeship Patterns.
</li>
<li>Our check-in groups changed, but 3 of us from our last check-in
group are together again!
</li>
<li>Most of the day was spent with Git.  In the morning, I learned that
setting <code>push.default</code> to <code>nothing</code> will prevent pushing any
branches without specifying explicitly which branch I want to push.
</li>
<li>Also, later in the day, Alan gave a presentation mapping the
internals of git to the commands, trying to give everyone a better
mental model of Git.
</li>
<li>I spent some time trying to get <code>jedi</code> integration for <code>emacs</code>. It
should've worked out of the box, but I'm not sure the ELPA
repositories have proper dependency/version management.  Seems to be
the problem, everywhere!  Dependencies of a package get updated, and
the package starts acting up…
</li>
<li>Chaitu sent me a link about solving mazes using Finite Automata, and
I spent some time trying to write a simple solver, and compare it
with Nava's breadth first search.  But, it looks like we broke her
code during the refactor.  I may get back to this, at some point.
</li>
<li>I also spent a few minutes talking to Kyle, while he was trying to
implement a simple version of the NTP protocol.  The algorithm it
turns out, is pretty simple.
</li>
<li>I started reading a little bit on crypt-analysis for Simple
Substitution ciphers, and I'll try implementing one of the
algorithms today.
</li>
<li>The day ended with yummy pizza and video watching!  We watched –

<li>I spent most of Saturday, thinking about what I should be doing for
the next few weeks, and what I really want to get out of Hacker
School.
</li>
<li>I had a good discussion with Naren about things that he works on,
and the kind of things that he sees as hard, what kind of things
interest me, and what I want to do post Hacker School.  I always
knew, I didn't really have an area of expertise or an area that I'm
super interested in, where I want to work.  This discussion only was
a verbalizing of those thoughts.
</li>
<li>I am not sure, I am very happy with the way I have been learning
Haskell.  The UPenn course has been reasonably good with the
exercises provided, and I have been learning through "pseudo"
projects.  But, I'm wondering if I should pick up a more concrete
project.
</li>
<li>I played around a little bit with Elm and started something to try
and write <a href="https://github.com/huckerdom/layout">Layout</a> using Elm.
