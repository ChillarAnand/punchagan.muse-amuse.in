I'm now officially a part of the Arch Linux community! Arch Linux
is a lightweight and flexible Linux® distribution that tries to
Keep It Simple.
</p>

<p>
I have started using arch from less than a week or so. It took me
a while, not too long, to realize the beauty of this distro. I was
trying to tweak the settings of my org-mode's remember (on
Karmic), trying to make it work the way I liked it. After breaking
my head with .emacs and lisp for a while, I realized the version
of my org-mode was way different from the version of the docs, I
was reading. It didn't take long to figure out, which version of
org-mode to get. As a matter of curiosity, I checked AUR for the
version, and true to Arch's reputation it was bleeding edge! I was
still using Karmic, since I hadn't got my Arch installation
working the way I like it, yet. Out of laziness. sudo reboot; to
hell with laziness!
</p>

<p>
I was setting up things I regularly use, tweaking my way
around. After a day or so, I find python-numpy is out of date. And
to top it, an orphaned package! I didn't feel one bit good about
this. After some futile attempts to suppress my discomfort, I sat
down to work.
</p>

<p>
After an afternoon of effort, I created my first PKGBUILD. :) I
now have python-numpy installed using pacman! Pleasure to join the
Arch User Community! Also, thanks to lifeeth and Lynus Vaz, for
the sparks.
</p>

<p>
PS: I'm using Arch with Openbox. It's neat! PPS: org-mode is
really awesome! It's a world in itself. life in plain text,
truly!]

I loved this Google doodle and immediately felt the urge to wish
all of you (using it). I haven't been at home for Sankranti (read

much of a kite-flyer, but I did have my share of moments! Hope you

I've been caught "shooting" with a camera and looked upon as
'terrorist' material. Not once or twice, but 4 times, at 3
different places, by different people. Friends with "pro" cameras
(or pro-looking ones) have been stopped on quite a few occasions
being mistaken for reporters. I'm not talking of those
instances. I am counting the times when I've been in "real"
trouble and was treated as a potential terrorist. Four Times.
</p>

<p>
The last time was special, since I was robbed of cash by a Public
servant in the 'Khakhi', who was apparently doing his duties! I
leave the cribbing about corrupt men and lost cash for later. It
obviously didn't feel nice, being treated in that fashion.
</p>

<p>
And that, just for having a camera and trying to learn the art of
"shooting" pictures. Thankfully, it was something that I could,
shut off (along with my mouth) and throw into my backpack.

What of people born to parents who believe in a particular

suspected for dressing the way their fathers and mothers and

<p>
Don't tell me I didn't warn you, if you walk into our lab sometime
and mistake it for a game zone in your neighbourhood. You are
indeed in "the" lab. If you came looking for Prof. Prabhu you'll
have to return. You'll only find PR vowing to see the end of
baali, for having a nice time pawning him. You won't find me
around - I'm cloaked and busy creating havoc. Unless, of course,
you are the seer KD. Watch your step extremely carefully or you
won't know when and how fuchmed's GM hit you. And don't dare
venture anywhere near madrazr, jumping all around with a
shockwave, unless you are capable enjoying some real nasty
shocks. Well, the team is busy in one of it's two SB sessions per
day. SB (short for Stress Buster) sessions are intense 15 minute
rounds of bzflag - 3D first person tank battle game.
</p>

<p>
Hope you didn't start thinking, I'm just goofing off here, doing
nothing at all. If it's not already clear, SB sessions are exactly
what they are called - Stress Busters. Just to refresh ourselves
and get back to work, with greater force. What then, am I doing
for the rest of my time?
</p>

<p>
Mainly I've been developing course content that we have been
working on, called Software Tools, Techniques and Practices. I
have been working on a session for elementary LaTeX and basic
Linux tools. I've also been attending classes of Digital Control
and trying to Python-ize the Matlab/Scilab code that the course
uses.
</p>

<p>
But, that's not all. I've helped a guy restore a Joomla site on
Day-1. I screwed up a brand new installation of a server with some
real skill; then expect to be screwed but get some encouragement
with the words, "It was a good learning experience for us." Seen a
Debian server upgrade from Etch to Lenny in under 10
minutes. Installed an instance of twiki and struggled to configure
it. Helped a Humanities Scholar with LaTeX. Attended a workshop on
Instruction Design. Restored Qmail on an old Fedora 3
server. Goofed around in gimp, for a CD cover and a T-shirt
design. Chipped in with bits, for mutating Ubuntu into
"LivePython". Did a bit of css and javascript tweaking… The list
goes on!
</p>

<p>
Now, don't you think we deserve the SB's? ;)

Lost in thought, in the maddening crowd waiting for the next train
on a Sunday evening, I was staring blankly, looking at nothing in
particular. I had come to see-off UC, Sunil and 9.
</p>

<p>
A man carrying a stretcher on his head, suddenly comes into my
focus and I have an impulse to look down. But, I manage to look at
people who are closer to the guy, and see looks of pity, shock and
disgust. Most of them looked down, sooner than later. It was not
long before the man, was right next to me and I could see an
injured man lying on the stretcher with a stream of blood oozing
out of his head. All I could manage was another expression of
pity, shock and disgust. I didn't want to act as if I had seen
nothing. I didn't want to stay as if I could do nothing about
it. I didn't want to look down. But, that's all I ended up
doing. The man carrying the stretcher was not exactly struggling,
but I'm sure he would've more than liked some help. Not one
amongst us moved.
</p>

<p>
Around half a minute later, I see a constable walking calmly
(maybe with a shade of concern in his stride) in that
direction. The next train was there in less than a minute and 9
got into it. I was feeling absolute disgust at my reaction. In the
hope of making some amends, I walked in the direction that the
stretcher guy took. Soon I found them. I didn't have to
search. There was an audience of onlookers, watching the stretcher
carrying guy inspect the other guy. He was waiting near the
entrance of the station and I'm guessing he had called for some
medical help and was waiting for it to arrive. The policeman and a
couple of others were standing next to him, while he was
inspecting the injuries. Everybody else was watching — from the
stairs, from the over bridge, the platform, the
tracks. Everywhere. Being a part of that crowd was the last thing
I wanted to do. I walked away.
</p>

<p>
PS: I (infact, we - uc, sunil, 9 and me) have had my own tryst
with the Mumbai local. Keep your head on your shoulders, while you
are anywhere near them. They are not the trains in your local
fair.

Well, this could be called a post after ages, considering that
most of previous posts have just been 'news reports'. I have been
wanting to make a post since long, but I probably lost it. I
really am unable to write anything that I find worth posting [It
does raise questions about the existence of this blog. I'm writing
this, to answer that question to myself.]
</p>

<p>
This post is provoked by an act of sharing, an act of kindness, an
act of goodness, that surprised me. This post isn't about the act
itself, but it's about me being surprised. Why on earth should I
(or anybody) be surprised, when someone is just being human?
Aren't human beings meant to be and feel human?
</p>

<p>
I wonder why people say, "this is a bad, bad world." I find a lot
of goodness and humanness around me. Unless I strain my memory
really hard, I can only recall people who try to be as good and
nice as they can be; People trying to be as human as
possible. Either there's something utterly wrong with my judgment
of people or there's something wrong with the general feeling that
the world is a bad, bad place.
</p>

<p>
There's one other possibility that just strikes me - I am so nice
to people that, everyone else tries to be nice with me. I don't
think I am such a big deviation from the average. I'm just another
goat, in the great herd.
</p>

<p>
And another one, I'm in a really special place, presently. I have
been only to the special places. I have visited only the places
that are at an extreme, far away from the 'average' place in the
world. But, given I'm just another goat in the great herd, this is
very unlikely. I am probably grazing at a random spot on the great
grasslands.
</p>

<p>
Since these are ruled out, it boils down to either a wrong
judgment or a wrong general feeling.
</p>

<p>
Coming to my judgment, I wouldn't call myself an Oracle or the
wise one, but I'm no dumb ass either. Well, taking the statistical
route, the number of times I've had any real "nasty" surprises in
dealing with people has been much lesser than the number of times
things turned out nearly as expected. My judgment could,
therefore, possibly given some credibility.
</p>

<p>
So, that leaves me with just one possibility. The idea that the
world is a bad, bad place is not entirely true, if not completely
absurd and outright wrong. The world is really a nice place, with
"human" beings inhabiting it. The nasty surprises that you get,
really are the surprises and not the general rule.

    <div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
Well, there are a hazaar tutorials on setting up Postfix and
Mailman for Debian for a single domain. There were a few for doing
that for multiple domains also, but nothing comprehensive, if I
could say so. This link is pretty comprehensive and details all
the steps for setting up Postfix for a single domain.  Here is all
you'll want to know about setting up Virtual domains in Postfix.
</p>

<p>
You only need to make a few changes for adding a second (or more)
domain. You just need to add the <code>virtual_alias_domains</code> and add
<code>virtual_alias_maps</code>. Here is a glimpse of how my <code>main.cf</code> looks:
</p>

<pre class="example">
myhostname = mail.abc.in
mydomain = abc.in
mydestination = $myhostname, $mydomain, localhost.$mydomain
myorigin = /etc/mailname
virtual_alias_maps =
                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-xyz,
                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-abc,
                hash:/var/lib/mailman/data/virtual-mailman
virtual_alias_domains = xyz.in, mail.xyz.in
</pre>

<p>
<code>virtual-xyz</code> and <code>virtual-abc</code> contain the virtual aliases for
each domain. Note that Postfix expects hash files and hence you
need to run <code>postmap /etc/postfix/virtual-abc</code> each
time the file is changed, to keep the hash file in sync with the
text file that you edit. Also, you need to run <code>postfix reload</code>,
each time you make changes to <code>main.cf</code> or <code>master.cf</code>
</p>

<p>
Fairly straight forward, right? But it took me quite sometime to
get it all right, since this was the first time I was doing
anything with Mail Transfer Agents or the like.
</p>

<p>
Now, onto Mailman. Well the Installation Manual of Mailman,
literally has it all. Here is a look at how my
<code>mm_cfg.py</code> looks:
</p>

<pre class="example">
DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST = 'abc.in'
DEFAULT_URL_HOST   = 'mail.abc.in'
add_virtualhost(DEFAULT_URL_HOST, DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST)
POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS=['xyz.in']
add_virtualhost('mail.xyz.in', 'xyz.in')
MTA='Postfix'
</pre>

<p>
The only trouble was to get mailing lists with same names on both
the domains (which I couldn't get working). I experimented with
multiple mailman instances but that won't work because the MTA
can't differentiate between the two instances of mailman. The
alternative is probably to have two instances of postfix running
too. But that I felt was like going too far, and gave up. [What if
we wanted to add another domain to the list?!]
</p>

<p>
Also, I had to make a few alterations to the Apache file to allow
access to the mailman pages without breaking the Zope redirection
that was already set-up.
</p>

<p>
[Thanks to Shantanu and Vattam (and all the hazaar people using
Postfix and Mailman and cared to document things for the sake of
others, and of course Google)]

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2009</span>
    </header>
    <div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
I had the opportunity to attend a FOSS talk session organized by
Center for Distance Education Engineering Programme (CDEEP) as a
part of the National Mission on Education through ICT. The
National Mission on Education through ICT has some lofty goals,
which when reached will take the country ahead by leaps and
bounds.
</p>

<p>
The Mission has a budget of $1billion in the 11th Five year plan,
40% of which will be spent on content generation (all of which
will be free/open source) and the rest will be spent on making
available a minimum bandwidth of 1Gbps to the 30,000 odd colleges
spread over India (out of which around 3000 are Engineering
colleges). The mission has various projects planned and they are
picking up steam rapidly. The project I will be working on, for
the Adoption of Open Source in Engineering and Science Education
in India, is also a part of this Mission. Prof. Kannan had kick
started the session with an introduction to the National Mission
on Education through ICT. The talks were all being webcast to
various EduSAT centers and on the web.
</p>

<p>
Then, Prof. Pathak talked on, why open source is important. He
said, (not exactly quoting him) " It is theoritically possible for
any person to learn and discover things from scratch, but there's
been only one Ekalavya in the entire history of India." Education
is a social activity and hence open access to content is
absolutely vital. He mentioned various things like how IIT-B has
been working on Creative Commons licensing and other things going
on here. He ended the talk with a hope that soon India will move
from being a net taker of Open source to a net giver to open
source.
</p>

<p>
This was followed by three talks, delivered by developers from
RedHat meant for programmers who wish to contribute to FLOSS.
</p>

<p>
The first talk was by Ramakrishna Reddy, titled 10 things a FLOSS
developer should know. It was a pretty nice and balanced talk,
covering a wide range of things. I would like to point out a few
things, that I liked the most.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He clarified the term hacker as soon as he used it.
</li>
<li>He emphasized a lot on groking code; reading code for fun,
looking at the code of others, reading as much code as
possible…
</li>
<li>He talked of muscle memory of emacsen. I liked the way he talked
of people being so quick with their editors and how learning to
use your tools effectively is a big plus
</li>
<li>Release often, Release early. Everybody talks of it, but he said
a few words, which I liked. Some developers don't usually
release their code as early for the fear of being ridiculed. But
don't bother, "we are just small people, in the whole galaxy."
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The next talk was by Prasad Pandit on How to use Infrastructure
for FOSS projects. Prasad talked of Website, Version Control,
Mailing list, IRC, Bugzilla, Wiki and RSS feeds. He gave quite a
few examples on how each thing is important, most of the examples
being his personal experiences.
</p>

<p>
The last talk was by Rahul Sundaram and was on Communication in a
FOSS project. For a change he didn't have slides and the reason
for that, he said, is that communication in a FOSS project is
casual and not having slides and walking in with a t-shirt and
jeans represents that casualness which is a culture of FOSS
projects' communication.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be polite, but don't be Formal.
</li>
<li>Be precise, but do provide a context to what you are saying.
</li>
<li>Don't fear that you'll say something foolish, which, will be
archived for eternity. Mistakes are there to learn from. Not
just you, but others too.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
He talked of quite a lot of things, but these were the things
which struck me as particularly interesting/important.
</p>

<p>
At the end, all the participants walked out with Fedora 11 DVDs
from the RedHat/Fedora guys. :D
