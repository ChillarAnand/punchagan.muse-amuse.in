I first heard this book mentioned first, in a discussion on relationships
amongst friends from RC.  The discussion was quite interesting and the book
received more than a couple of +1s and I decided to pick it up.

It has been totally worth my time to read this book. The book is full of
codified common sense on what love is.  Gary Chapman, the author, started with
the question "What makes you feel loved" and found that the answers could be
grouped into the following 5 categories:

1. Words of affirmation
2. Quality time
3. Receiving gifts
4. Acts of service
5. Physical touch

He also found that people have a *primary* language of love, and a failure to
speak this language would make the person feel unloved.  The book is filled
with anecdotes to explain what each of these languages means and how to speak
them, along with practical advice and exercises to learn to speak each of these
languages.  Though the book has been written with couples in mind, the
fundamental ideas in this book can be applied to any relationships. I feel like
it has been helping me connect a few dots, ever since I've started reading it.

A highly recommended read!

Below are some of my notes. Feel free to suggest improvements (for readability
and otherwise) on the notes.
