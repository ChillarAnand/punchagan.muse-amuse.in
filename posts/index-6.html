<li>As preparation for a one-on-one this week with one of the facilitators, I was
wondering if I was really getting better as a programmer, by doing what I am
doing.
</li>
<li>I have heard at numerous places that reading and reflection are keys to
getting better. I feel like I haven't been giving these things much attention
in the past couple of weeks. I don't catch up on reading all the awesome
reading material shared on Zulip and I switched from writing this blog post
first thing in the morning, to any-time-after-lunch. I don't think this
worked out very well. Writing the post worked as a way to reflect on what I
had done yesterday, and what I should be doing today. So, I am back to
writing the blog post, first thing in the morning!
</li>
<li>Yesterday, I worked on indexing the Python sources in a way that the
inspection code can look up, later.  During this process, I found that my
code to use libclang's AST wasn't generic enough, and I had to clean it up to
be able to extract useful information from any file in the <code>cpython</code> sources.
</li>
<li>We also got to attend a super-awesome talk by <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Labnik</a>! He talked about
his progression from being an application developer, to writing libraries, to
working on languages (as a professional developer). He made a lot of
interesting and inspiring points during his talk.  Some of those that stuck
with me are:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>None of these is particularly harder than any of the other. Depending on
each person's personality, or the way their brain works, they are good at
doing one or the other.
</li>
<li>Getting good at programming is a matter of showing up, more than about the
"genes".  He repeated quite a few times that he disliked the idea of "baby
hacker", and left out the story of his childhood and college programming
days! I'm totally stealing his idea of meeting every saturday at 1pm, with
a bunch of friends and working until it was 10pm or so, when they could get
cheap beer and food!  And he did this all through his college!  It is
interesting that this idea is so similar to Hacker School!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was a very enjoyable and inspiring talk on the whole.
</p>
</li>
<li>The plan for today is to actually have the parsed information dumped into
some persistent format, and modify the inspect code to actually use it.
</li>
<li>I will also be pairing with Kyle for a few hours on working through some of

I took it easy during the weekend, and went on a nice camp with my a cousin's
family to TobyHanna State Park for a day or so, and spent the remaining (long)
weekend at their place in PA.  It was a pretty nice break!
</p>

<p>
Yesterday evening, I talked to Madhu about how ugly my code looked while I was
trying to use <code>libclang</code>, and he told me that he found a lot of wrapped C++/C
libraries end up being that way, and I also realized that using the Python AST
library seemed much cleaner, because it just contained Python objects, but
representing C/C++ objects in an AST and interacting with them in Python, isn't
that clean.
</p>

<p>
I cleaned up my code, and removed all the ugly regexes to use libclang to do
the parsing of the libs, and get the source code.  I basically got all the
tests passing, but they were taking an order of magnitude longer to run.  So, I
guess the next step is to cache things somehow.
</p>

<p>
I also added support for viewing the sources of built-in types.  It was pretty
simple, once I had everything working with libclang.

<li>I pushed the code onto <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/cinspect">github</a> to let Allison and Tom review it, and Tom was
quite excited by the idea of having it.
</li>
<li>I added a startup script in IPython, to monkey-patch it to use my code for
introspection.
</li>
<li>Having never written a C-extension, I read up the Python docs on <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html">writing C
extensions</a>, and played around a little with <a href="https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/">pycparser</a>, but it didn't seem to
work too well with the Python's sources.
</li>
<li>I later went to the New York Public Library to see <a href="http://www.nypl.org/press/press-release/2013/06/26/new-york-public-library-display-historic-copies-declaration-independe">a copy of the Declaration

<li>I got distracted trying to add a hack to Hacker School's <a href="https://github.com/sursh/blaggregator">blaggregator</a>, to
enable posting to different channels on zulip.
</li>
<li>I learnt a few things about Django.  Commented out references to views that
don't exists breaks templating.  Formsets didn't seem very convenient to use,
for editing data showing the user only partial forms.
</li>
<li>I played around with Clang for a bit, to try and use libclang to parse the C
code for inspection, instead of writing one myself.  It sometimes feels like
an overkill, but it feels like it'll make the whole code more robust.  I'm
not sure.  I'll need to play around for a bit more to decide.
</li>
<li>I also finally got around to fix the resolution of my tty shells.  I was in a
bus, and wanted my laptop's battery to last longer, and decided to use a tty
shell with just emacs running. But, the resolution sucked.  So, I
fixed. Essentially it involved removing a blacklist file that an old version
of Nvidia drivers left behind in
<code>/usr/share/grub-gfxpayload-lists/blacklist/</code> and setting
<code>GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080</code> in <code>/etc/default/grub</code>.
</li>
<li>Later in the evening I also bought the domain <code>octo.cat</code>, given there were a
bunch of people buying cat domains, and talking about it on Zulip!

exercise, and I built one that is not persistent, in the two hours.  I worked
on a not so important problem of having sorted query parameters, instead of
the more important problem of having a persistent server.  Anyway, I should
be building something that works, first, before trying to solve the more
interesting problems.  At least on Fridays.

<li>I like how some of the people here are taking check-ins so seriously.  A
bunch of people posted messages on Zulip, informing that they would not be
able to make it to check-ins, and seemed quite sorry about it.
</li>
<li>Check-ins are indeed useful.  At the end of every day, I review my work
wondering what I did, and sometimes end up pushing myself harder, to have
something reasonable to talk about during the check-ins!
</li>
<li>Yesterday, I read up about FFTs and ended up playing around with <code>fft</code> in
<code>scipy</code>, and played around with audacity, etc.  Nothing concrete, really.
</li>
<li>There was a "goals" workshop by Stacey, where she talked about how to get the
most out of this batch of Hacker School, and then we split into groups of 3,
and presented our goal-statements to each other, and gave our impressions of
each others' goals.
</li>
<li>I didn't really have a goal, but the exercise seemed to help, anyway.
</li>
<li>Also, I think it is making me nervous to treat Hacker School as
super-important.  It is important to make the best use of every hour, every
minute here, but at the same time, I shouldn't be constantly worrying about
whether or not, whatever I'm doing is the best use of my time here.
</li>
<li>I think I would like to form some good habits, and make a few good friends,
more than finish projects and build something uber-cool.  Of course, it would
be great to build awesome stuff (and may be the only reasonable way to form
habits, and make friends) but I shouldn't worry too much about time running
out. Never Graduate!
