- I spent the morning doing some white-boarding interview practice with a Jorge
  and Brian.
- I spent the rest of the day, playing with PyPy and working through [[http://morepypy.blogspot.in/2011/04/tutorial-writing-interpreter-with-pypy.html][a tutorial]]
  that teaches us to write a BF interpreter.
- I spent the Saturday revamping my Emacs config.  The main issue with my
  config was having a "package" list, of all the packages that the
  configuration uses, in case we are trying to duplicate it elsewhere.  I
  noticed that this gets out of sync, because I install packages by hand and
  never update this list.  I wrote up [[https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/user-lisp/setup-defuns.el][some code]], that keeps this list in sync
  with all the packages I have installed.  I configured el-get to play well
  with my config, and am pretty happy with my setup, though I still have to add
  some matching/searching features with helm/ido/whatever else.
- I spent the Sunday writing a patch to [[https://github.com/punchagan/xtab/tree/kill-by-memory][xtab]] to be able to limit the number of
  tabs in Chromium by the memory it uses.
