<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; hi all
</p>

<p>
&lt;BerntH&gt; hi punchagan   [18:36]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; BerntH: ever used/tried blorg or blorgit?  [18:47]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I like the way org-publish works, but blorg exports one org file as a blog. If blorg were to be re-written on top of org-publish, how should it be done? use one file per post or just one file for the whole blog?  [18:52]
</p>

<p>
&lt;bremner&gt; punchagan: another option is to use ikiwiki and use the org-mode plugin to render pages. This is what i do, although only a bit of the site is in org.  [19:44]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; bremner: can I have a look at your site?  [19:45]
</p>

<p>
&lt;bremner&gt; sure, it ain't pretty, but: www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner  [19:46]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; thanks. I'll keep this in mind.   [19:47]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I just loved the way this site looks and behaves – <a href="http://julien.danjou.info/projects.html">http://julien.danjou.info/projects.html</a>
</p>

<p>
&lt;bremner&gt; well, the side bar at least is possible with ikiwiki. Other than that I suppose it is mainly a matter of css  [19:48]
</p>

<p>
&lt;BerntH&gt; punchagan: nope  [19:49]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; ok BerntH  [19:50]
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan ikiwiki does have an org-mode plugin  [19:56]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: yes, bremner told me that and I've seen on Worg too. :)
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan ah, yes, sorry
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: it's alright.   [19:59]
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan another possibility is org2blog, which uses wordpress
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: I'm the author of it. :D
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; lol, ik, <b>that</b> punchagan   [20:17]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; lol
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: were you kidding? or serious?  [20:19]
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; punchagan sorry to say i was serious, but it will not happen again :-)
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; i really like org2blog, played with it yesterday
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; plovs: no. I was just wondering if you were playing around with me. :P
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I'm happy some one thinks it is useful.
</p>

<p>
&lt;plovs&gt; lol, no, i just didn't recognized your name, although it is kind of hard to miss  [20:21]
</p>

<p>
&lt;punchagan&gt; I hope you don't mind, if I make this anecdote public?

This post is by Dominick Mills, coming to us, thanks to
Bloggerstock.  Dominick aka Lije blogs at Lije's Mindstate.  My post
on this month's Bloggerstock topic will appear at That Ain't Kosher.
</p>

<p>
And here is Dominick's post for you
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Hello world..today I'll be talking about a period in time I would like
to do-over, however I couldn't think of anything so I went in another
direction….I'd like to thank Bloggerstock and punchagan for
the opportunity leak my thoughts on this page….
</p>

<p>
I hope the readers understand that my views does not reflect those of
the host's page..before I get started though Let me take the time out
to explain what Bloggerstock is all about.  Bloggerstock is the
brainchild of a small group of bloggers who connected on 20SB. The
idea comes from the concept of a blog-swap in that maybe we could
create our own kind of event where we all wrote posts to be posted on
the next person’s blog. Essentially forming a blog-ring.
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of things in life everyone would like to relive and do
differently..I've been giving it some thought and it's been racking my
brain for the whole month now…I came to the conclusion that I have
nothing I'd like to really do-over…
</p>

<p>
My reason for this is that I wouldn't be this person I am…and I
wouldn't alter it in anyway…I love what I've become…if it weren't
for all the good and bad that occurred during my life time..I wouldn't
even be here writing this….or I wouldn't even have the same goals
and all my aspirations would be small…I know this all sounds weird
but giving the fact that I am a weird person, those who know me, this
is expected…I believe in things happening for a reason and without
these occurrences we'd be something totally different, and
</p>

<p>
maybe not becoming what we're suppose to be in life…sometimes we
look at situations and think, " Just maybe if I had done this… or
maybe if I hadn't…" even if my decisions had made into a bum on the
streets I think I would feel the same way…truth is we all have
regrets..learning to live with them is the hardest thing to do..we
tend to get caught up in the moment and want to relive those
things..either for the good or the bad…but we fail to realize that
it is those things that build character not for today but for our
tomorrows.
</p>

<p>
Whether it's falling for the wrong person, being back stabbed from a
friend, getting hoodwinked from a stranger, or missing out on an
opportunity….all of these are just life's lessons being taught..with
that being said you should never sulk over a decision we've made…in
the end we're our own cause of grief or happiness so don't whine about
it stuff that's happened….accept what has happened and move
forward…don't hold on to them, but don't forget them either…these
are turning points in our lives so appreciate them..
</p>

<p>
Well that's all I have to conjure up on the matter..though it kind of
went against the topic a bit but hey am stubborn lol.. once again I'd
like to thank punchagan for allowing me to feature on Rustic
Reverie and also Bloggerstock for providing me with the opportunity to
express myself on a fellow blogger's page.. here's a link to my page
to view my featured blog post

    <p>
Just back after attending PyCon India '10. It was not as exciting
as I hoped it would be.  That's generally the case with any
conference I attend.  (I guess, I expect too much from them. :P)
</p>

<p>
The keynote by David Goodger (pronounced like Badger :) was
"Good".  It was a very simple one talking of how to get Python
into the workplace.  His simple recommendation was to use Python
if we saw any opportunity where it could be used, without
bothering about permissions, convincing people etc.  "It's better
to ask for forgiveness, than for permission."  He spoke of myths
around Python – scripting language, dynamic language, too much
white space, toy language, nobody uses it.  He concluded the talk,
by saying mentioning Indian driving to be an indication of some
quick reflexes that we Indians have. ;) On the whole it was an
enlightening, humorous and enjoyable talk.
</p>

<p>
I didn't attend too many of other talks.  Amongst the ones that I
did attend, I particularly liked the one by Asim Mittal on using
the Nintendo Wii with Python.
</p>

<p>
On some thought about my experiences at conferences, I think
conferences shouldn't have any talks at all.  Or atleast, I
shouldn't be attending conferences for talks.  They are an excuse
to catch-up with people.  Conferences should have only lightning
talks of 10 mins and sprints.  Talks, with an extensive
explanation of stuff that can be easily found on the web, are a
waste of time.

Should one take the easy route of asking someone who knows, if she
is sitting right next to you? Or should we try and find out first,
before asking her? Should one value his time more than others' or
others' time more than his own?
</p>

<p>
Would we learn more if we tried to find out ourselves? Does
learning more, make sense? Is it worth spending the extra time?
</p>

<p>
I'm just talking of simple things that you could figure out by
spending a couple of minutes of searching the web or 5 minutes of
thinking or 10 minutes of reading a book.

The thrill of getting the GNU (and the GNU itself) and shaking hands,
