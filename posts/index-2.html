The ideal presentation should be aimed at an audience of gentleman
and lady programmers—smart, and generally capable but without,
necessarily, any specific knowledge of the domain from which the
code comes. Presentations should provide enough context for the
audience to to understand what the code is and should explain any
details of the implementation language that may be obscure to the
average programmer.

As reported in various places, there was an incident in early
November where commits in our Git repositories have become misplaced
temporarily by accident. By the mid next week we were able to
resurrect all the commits and things are back to normal now.

As there are many confusions and misunderstandings in people’s
commentary, we wrote this post to clarify what exactly happened and
what we are doing to prevent this.

<li>I spent the morning cleaning up the "repr" functions of the diff classes, so
that the diff of functions between two modules can be printed out in a
somewhat meaningful way.

<li>I feel like I didn't get much done yesterday.

<li>I mostly worked on the API differ, but didn't get much done.  I have a few
tests, and some code for diffing two functions, but I'm not very happy with
it.

<li>I helped Giorgio and Carlos with using my client only <code>hs_oauth</code>
  script/library, for their Zulip bot.
</li>
<li>The white boarding group worked on some binary related problems, and it was
fun.
</li>
<li>I looked at how the HS OAuth backend works on blaggregator and thought about
how to go about fixing the issue of broken images on the site.  The problem
happens because the image URLs are returned from the HS API calls, that are
made whenever a user logs in(?), and the URLs are cached.  Since, HS uses
cloudfront for its assets, the URLs expire after a period of time, and the
cached urls in blag's database need to be updated.  There could be two ways
of doing it -
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Check if the URL 404s, every time a URL is requested, on the server side.
</li>
<li>Do it on the client side, with some javascript magic.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Intuitively, I feel like 2. would be better, but Madhu suggested
that 1. wouldn't be that bad either.  We could try both out, and see which
works better I suppose.

I'd be interested to try this out, sometime.
