  The irony is this is actually what ancient philosophy was intended
  to ameliorate. “Vain is the word of a philosopher,” Epicurus once
  said, “which does not heal the suffering of man.” Centuries later,
  Thoreau expressed this same thought: “To be a philosopher is not
  merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school . . . it
  is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically,
  but practically.”

  A lot of people mistake flashy ultimate for “good” ultimate—they
  think that chest-high layouts or 10-foot grabs in wolf packs are

  possession or get a block—and they aren’t easy to execute. Still,
  it’s the most mundane things that often make the biggest impacts on
  the field.
