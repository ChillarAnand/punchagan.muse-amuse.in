#+END_COMMENT

* Friday

  - I started playing around with React.js to see how I could build the GitHub
    organization dashboard, that I plan to.

* Saturday

  - Got a horrendous idea of implementing a disqus-like commenting system using
    GitHub's issue comments, and ran with it.  It seems technically feasible
    based on some initial implementation.  I need to clean-up/rewrite the
    prototype code on Monday.

* Sunday

  - I spent the Sunday with cousins at Central Park Zoo, Upper East Side River
  front.
