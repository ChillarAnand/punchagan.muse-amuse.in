- I spent the morning cleaning up the "repr" functions of the diff classes, so
  that the diff of functions between two modules can be printed out in a
  somewhat meaningful way.

- I spent most of the afternoon, preparing to make a small presentation on how
  ~sys.path~ works in Python.  I thought I didn't do as good a job of it, as I
  would've liked, but Tom thought it was not too bad...

- Looks like another of those days, where I didn't get much done...  I spent
  the evening finishing off [[http://craphound.com/homeland/][Homeland]]. It's a brilliant book, and everyone who
  cares about the Government and policies and technology MUST read it!  Thanks
  Cory.
