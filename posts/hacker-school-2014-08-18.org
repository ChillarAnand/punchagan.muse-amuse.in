- I refactored the API-diff code, and am pretty happy with what I have right
  now, and need to add support for diffing Classes. I'm considering using
  [[http://www.astroid.org][Atstroid]] instead of Python's ~ast~ module, since some of the work that I want
  to do, has already been done for me.
- With the white-boarding group, we worked on a set of simple exercises for
  strings and arrays.
- Jos√© Valim's presentation on Elixir was interesting and got me reading up a
  stuff about concurrency, and related stuff.  Thanks!
