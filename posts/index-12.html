I’ve encountered a few misconceptions about what Hacker School is
and who it’s for. I’m not an official source of information; for
that, I recommend the User’s Manual and this blog post. Having said
that, here are a few things I’ve heard people say that attest to
misconceptions about Hacker School, and my responses to them.

From Angelo’s blog: “I remember the exact moment…Jen’s voice and the

also never forget how we looked into each other’s eyes and held each
other’s hands. ‘We are together, we’ll be ok.’”

<p>
We're one month into the second year of Catalyst, an after-school
tech/computer class that I run for kids aged 9-13, and this year
I've decided to try something different. [Last year, I had the kids
learn in a browser-based / console-like IDE that I created - kind of
like CodeAcademy, but ultimately it was just too much work to
maintain and too limiting]. My new plan is to teach the kids how to
build their own interactive websites from scratch using HTML, CSS
and Javascript, and to do it on their own Linux VPS (CentOS 6) using
Vim. I know it probably sounds crazy, but if the preliminary
reception and results are any indication, I think it's going to be a
success.

Himalayas to surfing in Orissa, here are some insane experiences.

I used to have a separate page for bookmarks and quotes on the old
blog.  They will now be shared as regular posts with 5 or more
bookmarks/quotes.  I use a bookmarklet in my browser to capture links
to an org-file using org-capture protocol and then I have a small
plugin to Nikola, that looks at such captured bookmarks and quotes and
makes new posts out of them.  This workflow is inspired by Brett
Trepestra's <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/01/15/a-web-excursions-system-for-static-blogs/">web excursions</a> plugin.
</p>

<p>
The plugin is currently a part of my blog source, and not published to
Nikola's plugin repository since it is very specific to my setup.  But
if anybody is interested, I can publish the code somewhere public.

Sigh! I made yet another change to the way this blog gets published.
But, I have a feeling this mechanism, is here to stay!
</p>

<p>
We've been using Nikola quite regularly for our <a href="http://ultimatesport.in">Ultimate site</a>, and I
quite like it.  I've also contributed a bunch of features to Nikola to
get it to work the way I would like it to.  This weekend I ported my
blog from <a href="https://github.com/renard/o-blog">o-blog</a> to <a href="http://getnikola.com">Nikola</a>.  The only thing that was stopping me
from doing it, until now is the fact that all my posts are in
org markup and porting them over to one of the formats that Nikola
supports would be a PITA.  So, I wrote a <a href="http://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode">pretty simple plugin</a> to
Nikola to support posting from org files.  And then with a <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/6970578">little
Python</a>, I was able to move everything over to use Nikola.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, I'll keep my blog more updated, from here on!

<a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/modern-art-vs-toddler-art/">QUIZ: Modern Art or Children’s Drawings? | Bored Panda</a>

<p>
:art:
</p>

<p>
Art, and what we do and do not consider to be art, has changed a lot
over the last century. It has become an increasingly difficult thing
to define for the average person, and sometimes even art historians
and experts can’t seem to keep up.
</p>

<p>
This was illustrated in a 2005 survey done by ABC News in which
modern masters’ works were mixed into a series with paintings done
by children and toddlers. Regular people and art critics alike were
asked to choose from the series – which of these works belong in a
museum and which ones don’t? Now, Buzzfeed has released a similar
survey as well, which we’ve expanded on a bit.
</p>

<p>
The results of that survey indicate that either we have a long way
to go before we can define what is and isn’t modern art, or that
there’s no need to define it so strictly in the first
place. Whatever the case may be, let’s see if you’re any better at
telling modern art from children’s drawings than the experts are!

<li>The true Enlightenment thinker, the true rationalist, never wants to
talk anyone into anything. No, he does not even want to convince;
all the time he is aware that he may be wrong. Above all, he values
the intellectual independence of others too highly to want to
convince them in important matters. He would much rather invite
contradiction, preferably in the form of rational and disciplined
criticism. He seeks not to convince but to arouse — to challenge
others to form free opinions. – <i>Karl Popper – On Freedom</i>

not, I am classified as unread or not.  Well, you could call me
not well-read too, I guess.  I was looked at once, my innards
glanced through, and was hurriedly marked as unread, starred and
tagged.  Given my length, the care with which I was composed, and
the flurry with which I was stowed away, I probably contain
something important, to be read at the opportune moment, something
to be cherished and to be replied to with diligence and care.  I
felt a sense of pride.
</p>

<p>
I got composed and sent weeks ago, and have been lying here
untouched, since.  I get buried deeper and deeper every day, with
a daily flood of newer stuff piling up onto me.  While my
composer, eagerly awaits a reply, (less and less eagerly each day,
though) I have lost all hope of being read and replied to.  I
curse myself for carrying something so important.  A thousand
other replies have been sent, and a few thousand others composed
here, but my turn hasn't come, yet.
</p>

<p>
How I wish, it'd be my turn today.  How I wish, I could push my
way up through to the top of the stack.  How I wish, I could see
the eager wait come to an end!  How I wish, I'm given the
attention I deserved, today!  Reply, ASAP!
</p>

<p>
PS: Apologies for all those emails that are still starred and
unread, in my Inbox…
