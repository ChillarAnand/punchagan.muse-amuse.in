    <p>
It was a pleasant Saturday evening in the middle of the winter. Christmas was
just round the corner and love in the air. The sun was just setting and
everything outside his window was given a fresh coat of snow, tickled by the
red, quickly fading light. Not that he noticed. He stared blankly out of the
window, looking at nothing in particular. He had just woken up from his
afternoon nap; but he'd buy it if you told him he'd been sleeping for a year…
</p>

<p>
You could see the icy river crawling ahead, from his window.  People walking
over the bridge, a few camera flashes going off, people stopping over and
looking far ahead into the horizon – collecting their thoughts, couples
walking hand-in-hand enjoying each others' company; You could see it all, from
up there! But, as they say, you only see what you look for. And he, couldn't
see any of this. His looked out of his window and saw none of this.
</p>

<p>
He is walking down the same bridge. He didn't know where he was going; his head
at least. His legs did; as always. He was walking down in his regular yellow
shirt and black jeans, that you could mistake for a uniform, if you followed
him for a few days. Extremely under-dressed for the chilly night, one would
say. He kept walking down the main street, lined with shops brightly lit up for
the festive season. The pavement bustled with with people walking with a spring
in their step – the spring that the festive season and all the love in the air
brought to you. Not that he noticed it, or had any of it in his step.
</p>

<p>
Soon, he's walking through the park. The park that was built to celebrate time,
ticking away furiously. Or to celebrate the time everyone in the world had, to
enjoy themselves. He walked past the skating rink, with lots of people having
the time of their life, ice skating; and a lot more, awaiting their turn. The
first timers, old and young, making up for their inexperience, with their
excitement; holding onto whatever they can, to finish each round, to start the
next! The veterans, taking the center-stage and showing off their moves!  He
was barely aware of their presence and just walked on, past all the action.
</p>

<p>
The music festival; he walked past it too, like the crowd didn't exist, the
noise didn't, the music didn't; like there was nothing happening! The fountain
"felt" no different. The cold breeze, did sprinkle the water to quite a
distance and everybody kept a safe distance to avoid the chilling shower,
except for the kids, who found it amusing to run into the shower for a split
second and run back madly. How could he walk just by it, and not feel a thing!
</p>

<p>
The lakefront. That is where his legs always brought him in the end. The
brilliantly lit skyline was a delight to watch, but I don't believe he saw any
of it. He just stared into it, blankly. He kept staring, as the night got
chillier and the surroundings kept getting more and more deserted. Seconds
ticked away, minutes and hours passed by! He stayed on, staring ahead. It
didn't matter how much below zero the mercury had gone. This wasn't the first
night he was spending staring into the nothingness. It turned out to be the
coldest night, in a decade. But that didn't matter to him. Nothing did. Nothing
has, for a while now; Ever since he turned cold.

<a href="http://twitter.com/avudem">Voodoo</a> found a broken link referring to a one of my posts, on Quora.
Given that I have changed my site generator a bunch of times now, it
is quite possible that there are other broken links at various other
places.  So, I implemented a smart <a href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/this-is-a-fun-hack">404 page</a> for the site, yesterday.
It is very similar to something I came across on <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/04/07/fun-with-intelligent-404-pages/">brettterpstra</a>'s site.

The irony is this is actually what ancient philosophy was intended
to ameliorate. “Vain is the word of a philosopher,” Epicurus once
said, “which does not heal the suffering of man.” Centuries later,
Thoreau expressed this same thought: “To be a philosopher is not
merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school . . . it
is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically,
but practically.”

A lot of people mistake flashy ultimate for “good” ultimate—they
think that chest-high layouts or 10-foot grabs in wolf packs are
hallmarks of the elite game. But I beg to differ. It’s true,
sometimes incredible feats of athleticism are the only way to save a
possession or get a block—and they aren’t easy to execute. Still,
it’s the most mundane things that often make the biggest impacts on
the field.

There is a time and a place for reflection and contemplation about
the greater universe. Now, I know I sound like a hypocrite because I
do write about these things a lot, but I’ll tell you now, as someone
who does over-think it, sometimes you just have to let it be what it
is and not become overwhelmed by the vastness, mysteriousness and
unknown possibility that lies around us. It can be more debilitating
than inspiring sometimes.

little consequence. So we keep skittering along the surface at a

I’ve found recently that when the time is used well, slowness can
actually be one of the most profound sources of abundance.

And on the positive side, sometimes entrepreneurs work on their

<p>
We're one month into the second year of Catalyst, an after-school
tech/computer class that I run for kids aged 9-13, and this year
I've decided to try something different. [Last year, I had the kids
learn in a browser-based / console-like IDE that I created - kind of
like CodeAcademy, but ultimately it was just too much work to
maintain and too limiting]. My new plan is to teach the kids how to
build their own interactive websites from scratch using HTML, CSS
and Javascript, and to do it on their own Linux VPS (CentOS 6) using
Vim. I know it probably sounds crazy, but if the preliminary
reception and results are any indication, I think it's going to be a
success.

crazy experiences that will go down the book of your memory
lane. From treading on Living Root Bridges in Cherrapunji to a bike
ride through Ladakh, trekking through the valley of flowers in
Himalayas to surfing in Orissa, here are some insane experiences.

I used to have a separate page for bookmarks and quotes on the old
blog.  They will now be shared as regular posts with 5 or more
bookmarks/quotes.  I use a bookmarklet in my browser to capture links
to an org-file using org-capture protocol and then I have a small
plugin to Nikola, that looks at such captured bookmarks and quotes and
makes new posts out of them.  This workflow is inspired by Brett
Trepestra's <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/01/15/a-web-excursions-system-for-static-blogs/">web excursions</a> plugin.
</p>

<p>
The plugin is currently a part of my blog source, and not published to
Nikola's plugin repository since it is very specific to my setup.  But
if anybody is interested, I can publish the code somewhere public.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested to get these links and bookmarks into your feed reader,
you can subscribe to their feed: [quotes], <a href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/tags/cat_bookmarks.xml">bookmarks</a>.  These posts will also
make it to the main feed, though.

</p>

<p>
As a rough estimate, 95% of functions in any code base should be so
simple and specific that their signature is all you need to use
them. If they are not, API design has failed: back to the drawing
board.

So I have just one wish for you–the good luck to be somewhere where
you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and
where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in
the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your
integrity. May you have that freedom.

<p>
The best explanation I was ever given (and maybe one of the biggest
“aha!” moments of my adult life) was that while extroverts are
energized by connecting and spending time with others, introverts
need inward-focused, alone time to recharge.
