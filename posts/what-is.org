This is a free world,
you are free to will and whim,
can it, at the cost of,
your brother n his freedom,be?

Life is price'less',
the big shots say, we realize.
is it why, you sell ya brethren's life,
cheaply, for personal gain?

The human'kind', we call ourselves,
aren't the rivers, the air,
the forests or our mother earth,
worthy of our acts of kindness?

We are making rapid strides,
from the micro to the nano,
is it just in sci &amp; tech, or does
it coop in our loves and lives too?

The world's a small place,
the wise and learned say,
is that why, not all have,
a roof, under which to stay?

Its a world of press n media,
is it why we are pressed at,
with news that's dubious,
in truth and worth as well?

We are all for world peace, they say,
do you alone, make up "the world"? I ask
How else would war, uncalled for
bring about world peace?

I want my piece is all I hear.
