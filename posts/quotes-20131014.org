- In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is
  then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We
  should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner
  spirit.  -- /Albert Schweitzer, 1875 - 1965/

- Anyone who cannot cope with mathematics is not fully human.  At best
  he is a tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe and
  not make messes in the house.  -- /Lazarus Long, Time Enough for
  Love/

- You probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you
  could know how seldom they do. -- /Olin Miller/

- If you judge people, you have no time to love them. -- /Mother Teresa/

- Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
  and not giving it. -- /William Arthur Ward/

  #+begin_verse
    Where the mind is without fear and the head held high;
    Where knowledge is free;
    Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
    Where words come out from the depth of truth;
    Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;
    Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
    Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action;
    Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

  /Rabindranath Tagore -- Let My Country Awake/

- The true Enlightenment thinker, the true rationalist, never wants to
  talk anyone into anything. No, he does not even want to convince;
  all the time he is aware that he may be wrong. Above all, he values
  the intellectual independence of others too highly to want to
  convince them in important matters. He would much rather invite
  contradiction, preferably in the form of rational and disciplined
  criticism. He seeks not to convince but to arouse â€” to challenge
  others to form free opinions. -- /Karl Popper -- On Freedom/

- Don't ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you
  come alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is
  people who have come alive. -- /Howard Thurman/

- All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't
  hurt. -- /Charles M Schultz/
