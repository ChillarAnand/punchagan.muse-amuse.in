There's a post already with 'exactly' this name…. by 9… here…
But this post doesn't have much to do with his post… [or may be it does??]
</p>

<p>
Here's a Quote on Mahatma Gandhi…
/Generations to come, it may be, will scarcely believe that such a
one, as this, ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. –
Albert Einstein/
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering…. what would happen if the name Albert
Einstein was replaced by punchagan… and it turned out
that.. there's a huge huge list of candidates for replacing
Mahatma Gandhi… [This is with due respect to the Mahatma and
Einstein.. I don't, in any sense, intend to say that the Mahatma
was not a Mahatma…]
</p>

<p>
All I want to say is… I am seeing a whole lot of new things, in
people around me, that inspire awe and respect in me… that every
person is unique… every person is special.. every person can
teach you something…. there's something to learn from
everyperson… that makes me believe God,truly, created man in his
own image…
</p>

<p>
I am grateful to all the people around me (and those not around
any more..)… who have shown, are showing, and will be showing me
things bright and beautiful… wise and wonderful… which
otherwise I would have failed to see..
</p>

<p>
I am grateful… for getting me back on track.. when i go
directionless,.. for setting me examples to emulate,… for being
with me whenever i needed and will need you…
</p>

<p>
[ I would've loved to write down each and every name here…. but
that's too big a job for this little being to achieve… ]
</p>


<p>
As William Arthur Ward says….
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
and not giving it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To All Jaani's of the World… Thanks a Lot… (I know that's too
small a word… but that's all I can give right now…)
</p>

<p>
/"God created man in His own image…. ﻿ God saw everything that He
had made, and indeed it was very good."/ Gen 1:27, 31
</p>

<p>
“A friend is one with whom you are comfortable, to whom you are
loyal, through whom you are blessed, and for whom you are
grateful.”  – William Arthur Ward
</p>

<p>
In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is
then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We
should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner
spirit.  – Albert Schweitzer

A few days back I received a letter from a friend, via post! [I
know most of you can't believe this… but ya.. its true..] I
wouldn't have believed it too… if only he didn't tell that to me
when we met online… {He spoilt the fun for me! :-(} So before
going to dinner one day…(a couple of weeks back..).. I checked
out the Hostel Assistants room for any post…. and "it" was right
on top of the pile!! [Now that I speak of a pile don't imagine
that a lot of people here get personal letters… most of them
were business correspondence, magazines or likewise…]
Neways.. it was a great feeling to even look at it!! A white
envelope… and my name on it.. in his most familiar writing on
it…[no.. i don't get letters from him often.. we have been
classmates for quite some time.. so…] … the stamp [A leapard
cat!]… and the two postmarks.. [of Pilani &amp;amp;
Zuarinagar!! :-P]… Holding the letter in my hand.. it felt
wonderful!! [I wanted to read it right then…. but went along for
dinner…]
</p>

<p>
After dinner… and a little time in the Children's
Park… [relaxing.. wid 9,UC,Voodoo n Ringo]… I opened it! It
was absolutely thrilling… to see a couple of pages written in
ink [he still uses ink pens!! ;-)]… With full enthu.. i read the
letter.. and obviously once wasn't enough to satiate my hunger.. i
went through it over and over and over… [i wanted to scribble
down a reply ASAP… but we had waves and quark coming up.. so i
waited for them to get over (I could've written another one
right??)…to get more matter into my letter..]
</p>

<p>
Why is such a simple joy of getting a letter from a friend [there
is email.. but… for me its nowhere close to snail mail…]
become so rare these days?? [Something that was such a regular
feature of the recent past.. is almost extinct now!!] Telephone
and the Internet…. they are the culprits… (are they??…..) In
today's global village… is post a bit too slow for comfort? Will
survival of the fittest ensure the extiction of this wonderful
species in the world of communication…??
</p>

<p>
Is a letter just a matter of communication…?… Isn't there
anything more to it… [Obviously there is… otherwise I wouldn't
be writing a blog-post on it…I would never think of writing a
post on an e-mail I get!! (unless it is superhuman.. or
something..)!!] Aren't we losing out on something wonderful??
</p>

To attract good fortune, spend a new coin on an old friend, share
an old pleasure with a new friend, and lift up the heart of a true
friend by writing his name on the wings of a dragon.  – Chinese

The Internet is so big, so powerful and pointless that for some
people it is a complete substitute for life.  – <i>Andrew Brown</i>

Such wonderful things they are… bringing to us.. such a joy
[even if its about something not so pleasant…]… the joy of
discovering things.. of realising a truth… that was hidden
somewhere within… brought out with an elegant swoooosh!!…
</p>

<p>
We, 9, Voodoo, Ravi, UC n me] were just walking on the
street… enjoying the evening… after a nice day @ Quark [Day
2]… We were having a casual discussion… not discussing
anything in particular… but somehow the discussion led to a
project uc,ravi n me [ and probably the others are too..(they
didn't talk abt it…)] are interested in… [i don't wanna give
any more info abt the project.. bcos it may seem over-ambitious to
a few.. not that it hasn't been done already…. but…]
neways….
</p>

<p>
so… while we were talkin abt it… uc said, he didn't have any
clue about that thing worked… and we all were wondering
too… thinking about some possible solutions/methods….[I was
actually trying to recollect something i came across… some time
back…] but then suddenly 9 jumped in, to say…
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Don't think about how 'that' works… Just think about how 'YOU'
would make it work!!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh my God!! now that's what's a REVELATION… I was just
dumb-struck… that one small statement of his… drowned me in
its depths… I feel I still haven't come out of it… A big big
revelation at the most unexpected of times, at the most unexpected
of places…. [though 9 wouldn't agree with this… being his
usual modest self…]
</p>

<p>
Its been proved time and again… "they" can occur
anywhere… anytime and to anyone… while you are on the
street.. in your room.. at work… or even in the loo… [Most ppl
have a lot of them here!!].. we just need to keep our eyes n ears
open… and most importantly our Mind……  ps: it seems…me not
delving out the details about our ambitious project.. makes this
post a little vague, uninteresting n difficult to relate to… but
still…  In the fields of observation chance favors only the
prepared mind –Louis Pasteur

A DJ nite's going on here.. for WAVES…. I just went there for a
while….  The arrangements were pretty good… with Huge huge
huge spks.. [I can still hear the Music quite loud.. sitting here
in my room.. which is quite a distance form the Venue…] There's
real Heart throbbing music [Literally… With speakers of over
15000W your heart really throbs… dub.. dub.. dub…] being
played there…
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering if we really needed such extravagant
stuff… I know that such events bring ppl together… but do we
need to spend so much money just to have a have a good dance with
friends?? When a large number of people aren't able to get their
basic neccessities like a Square Meal, Clean drinking water,
proper clothing and shelter… here we are enjoying a good dance
with friends… with elaborately made extravagant
arrangements… [of course the money isn't ours… but…] [ I
know a lot of guys wud've a lot to say against me…. but.. its
ok..]
</p>

<p>
There can't be perfect equality in this world… of which duality
is an integral part…. every elementary particle has a dual
nature… so its but obvious that every thing in this world has a
dual to it… so its not possible to have a perfect world with
everybody equally placed.. if there is a rich.. then there will be
a poor… if there is joy.. then there will be despair… if there
is light.. then there will be darkness…
</p>

<p>
But can't we do anything… can't we spread the light to every
place that we possibly could?? Can't we get together to minimize
the difference? Join the race against nature… do your bit…
</p>

<p>
This, probably, is a good place to start off…

Imagine a kid reading Shakespeare's Othello or As You Like
it…[or may be some other classic poem…] with great difficulty
he somehow manages to read the whole thing… [with all the
archaic language etc..] he understands the basic plot and the
story and likes it… but will he be able to appreciate the work?
Will he be able to see the beauty of it?? Isn't a good knowledge
of Language a bare essential for one to enjoy a Literary work??
</p>

<p>
Now consider a layman… listening to Classical [say Carnatic]
Music… if he's got no knowledge of the Basic structure and
organisation of Music in general or a Raga in particular.. then he
may enjoy the musical work… listen to it happily…. but will he
get the taste of its nectar from the fine intricacies in it??
Isn't a basic sense of Music… a knowledge of the language of
Music necessary to understand the fine points of a Musical piece??
</p>

<p>
Isn't the case similar with Science [Feynman says nature..]??
Without a proper knowledge base in Mathematics.. how would I
possibly understand and appreciate Physics/Science (in general..)
and Relativity in particular?? [I got this feeling, after class
today, for the zillionth time…] How can I possibly enjoy a
course in Relativity without a proper Math background???
</p>

<p>
I need to learn a lot of Mathematics.. its high time I do it… :(
</p>

<p>
To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across
a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature
… If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is
necessary to understand the language that she speaks in.

<b>Here comes the WikiCamp!!</b>
</p>

<p>
Its all about understanding and harnessing the power of wikis…
</p>

<p>
It aims to bring together the best minds from the Wiki/Internet
space to talk about issues,opportunities,future and evolution of
this powerful tool…
</p>

<p>
Demystifying terms like Collaborative Knowledge Sharing, Wisdom of
Crowds, Crowd Sourcing…
</p>

<p>
To enliven the "Spirit of Sharing"…. [That's what it means to
me!]
</p>

<p>
The event is scheduled for the 25th of February, and the venue is
at Tidel Park, Chennai.
</p>

<p>
Who's the Organiser?? Everyone is. WikiCamp runs as an
unconference, where everyone is an organizer and there is no
passive audience. So it is as much your event.The overall
co-ordination is being done by The Knowledge Foundation, the same
group behind events such as Barcamp Chennai, Blogcamp and
Proto.in.
</p>

<p>
I am a Promoter of this event… You can be one too…. just write
a post in your blog space… and help in telling the world about
it…

We are less than a week away from our supposedly dreaded
'test-1'… n i have no clue even about what the syllabus is, in
each course… There's 'Theory of Relativity', of which i'm able
to make no head or tail.. then there's 'Electrical Sciences',
which totally "transformed" my plans for this
sem… then…SPM.. muP.. POM… MT.. C&amp;amp;S………
</p>

<p>
There are loads and loads of other stuff too…
</p>

<p>
Relativity… Emacs…. C++… Python… Table Tennis… learning
a bit of Music… picking up practical electronic
skills… reading a few books…(quite a few actually..).. and so
on…. [not to forget.. attending classes… doing a bit of course
related work…]. The list seems only to be growing everyday…
</p>

<p>
There's nothing that I've crossed out yet.. there's not one thing
that's done to perfection…[with a third of the sem already
through!!] {I already get the feeling.. its "Another sem down the
drain"}
</p>

<p>
But didn't I begin this sem with plans to "rock" it?? Wasn't I
supposed to attend all the classes that I possible can?? What's it
that I've been doing for the past 5-6 weeks?
</p>

<p>
I don't know!! I really can't pinpoint what's been achieved in the
past one month or so… [other than of course quite a considerable
amount of sleep…….]
</p>

<p>
Why are things so horribly out of place?? What's to be done.. to
get on track asap.. I wonder… What should my priorities be? Why
am I being overwhelmed by the things I got to do?
</p>

<p>
I realise this time of my life is as precious as any
other… (probably more…) and i need to make the most of
it…. but what is that "most"?? [It's definitely not sleep!]
</p>

<p class="verse">
I wish to put together,<br>
all my time, energy and matter<br>
to do a job, little<br>
that will ob'ly be infinitesimal<br>
It wouldn't make me a hero<br>
but shouldn't amount to zero…<br>
<br>
to me, something tangible<br>
definitely seems possible<br>
because nothing is impossible<br>
if there is the quantum of struggle…<br>
<br>
but it must come<br>
before I get back home<br>
needn't create an uproar<br>
but before the end of semsester four<br>
</p>

<p>
[Don't mistake this for a poem… for it is not!! Its just some
scribbling of mine.. which will keep me alive if at the end of
this sem… there's nothing other than this.. which is
tangible… something concrete.. something "see"able]
