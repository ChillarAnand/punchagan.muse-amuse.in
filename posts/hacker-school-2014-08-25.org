- I spent some time cleaning up my [[py): ][gitqus]] code.  I plan to try it out on a
  "real site" today, and do a little polish of the UI.

- I worked with Dana and Marcus fixing a bunch of issues with the [[https://github.com/marqsm/LED-bot][HS LED
  Screen]]. I might work on it for a little bit today, doing a little more
  clean-up of the architecture.

- The Monday talk was Mary live coding a space invaders game.  It was a fun
  talk, that was very well planned.

- During the walk to the talk, Bert, Maia and I were talking about the idea of
  a School where projects were the atom of the curriculum, instead of courses.

- I'll spend some time preparing my talk for tonight's hack-and-tell.
