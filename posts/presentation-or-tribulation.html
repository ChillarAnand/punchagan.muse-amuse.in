    <p>
This semester [2-2] I had to give two presentations! As if that
was not enough trouble, the courses were (Principles of)
Management [POM] and (Theory of) Relativity [ThoR] !! The former
was with a group and the latter was an individual affair.. Each
one had its Trials and Tribulations… But at the end of each, I
feel equally foolish. None of them were worth the efforts…
</p>

<p>
The POM (a course whose reason for existence most of us fail to
understand) presentation was specially torturous to our group. We
had 8 members in our group, but to no avail. Nobody, other than
Bubbly, was bothered about it until we were neck deep. With just 3
days left for the last day to submit the Report/Soft copy, our
frantic searches began. We finally landed on an interesting topic,
A Case Study on AMUL… We started work only on the night before
the submission day… But the interest and excitement, [along with
deadline.. :P] got us through with amazing speed. All of us, were
through with our parts of the job before going to bed. The next
morning, I along with 9 put together everything, almost ready to
be submitted. But fate had other plans for us… The topic we
worked on was rejected! Reason:There's already a group working on
it!!
</p>

<p>
Back to square one… we began the search again. After much effort
we found a couple of topics and approached her for
approval. Though the topics weren't damn interesting.. they were
something we would've liked to work on. But all we get is another
rejection and a Magazine that had a ready-made case study! We were
supposed to speak on operations management[o.m] in a cosmetic
multinational! [2 days, to work on some *#&amp;amp;$# cosmetic firm!
Worasht!! Imagine writing a Report on a Presentation on a Report
in a Journal… and that too on a Cosmetic Company!!] The last
nail on the coffin was hit. We felt hopeless and work didn't start
again till the night before the D-Day.. Not interested in working
on that cosmetic thingy.. we decided to work on o.m in some other
firm, and HLL seemed a neat choice.
</p>

<p>
After slogging through the whole of the next morning, we somehow
managed to get the report ready and finally at 2 pm, me and 9 went
in search of a printer! None was found until 5:30 in the evening!!
Somehow we submitted it finally… Phew!
</p>

<p>
But that's not the end of the story. There was a lot more in store
for us. The presentation date. We were given a date, on which to
give the presentation, but couldn't give it on that day, for too
many people were called and there was too little time… Hats off
to our Ma'am for such wonderful managerial skills. We had to beg
her to allow us to present it on a date convenient to all of
us.[She insisted that we do it on a particular date, when we
already had other appointments!?!!] Finally, she agreed. Phew!
</p>

<p>
On the D-day, 8 people, 40 mins… it was fun! There wasn't enough
time left for my turn and so I hurried through my part, the
conclusion…. But,the best part of it all was that, even a
half-hearted, just-for-the-sake-of-it effort could impress her!!
The presentation passsed off as a "very good presentation"! [Not
"yaxcellent!", though]
</p>

<p>
Then the Relativity one! I had to speak on Kerr Black
Holes. I hadn't heard of them until one day Dr. A.K. Biswas gave
me the topic, and asked me to speak on it, after he finishes
teaching Schwarzchild Black Holes. It was all fine, until there
was just a week left for the Compre's to start and he didn't start
teaching about Black Holes!! This Monday he asked me when I was
going to give my talk. Hoping that he would teach at least a small
part of it during the last week, I chose Friday. [Even at the cost
of ruining my comprees..] But, he didn't even tell us what Black
holes were, leave alone discussing the Schild Black Hole. I was
trying my bit to work my way through it but 3 days were too few to
read all about static Black Holes and then move on to Rotating
ones! I had a tough time.. but tried my best to make head and tail
of it. Finally today, I thought I understood a decent part of it
and was ready to present it before the class.
</p>

<p>
After an unsteady and slow start, I managed to put across a few
points about Black Holes in general and the Kerr Geometry.  But
then, I wasn't very comfortable with the other parts of what I had
to present, and this clearly reflected in my talk. It was growing
dumber and dumber… So, Sir stopped and asked me if I was going
to present the Penrose Diagram, and I said no. Thankfully he
understood my situation and asked me what I wanted to present and
asked me to finish it off with a few of the simpler things. I
jabbered something and was done with it. Phew!
</p>

<p>
But what was the result of all this drama? Were the results
in proportion to the efforts put in? Were the presentations really
worth the effort?  If the intention of these presentations was to
increase the Knowledge base of the class, I think we achieved
nothing. If we were supposed to enlighten the class, then we
failed in a big big way. But if the intention was to increase our
own knowledge base, I would say we succeeded in a very small
way… There definitely are much more efficient ways to increase
our own knowledge base. So is there any other purpose for such
talks??
</p>

<p>
A final few things… [I know you are wondering why I wrote this
post. Such a long one. I don't know….]
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It would've been better had the topic change been in ThoR and
not in POM. I should have spoken on Black Holes in general and
Schwarzchild Black Holes. Not Kerr Black Holes.
</li>
<li>The two people who guided us/me in the Presentations had
contrasting opinion on the Internet! Our Ma'am considered the
Internet to be a Devil [or some such thing] She doesn't like
the fact that people get info for their presentations from the
net. [Why? we haven't figured out yet] Journals are god-like
for her!! Unlike her, our Dr.Biswas is quite respectful of
this wonderful tool.. the Internet.
</li>
<li>None of these presentations were comparable [in terms of
energy,excitement and fun we had!] to our last sem's
presentation, "Copyleft". Is it because Copyleft wasn't a
course related topic?? :P
</li>
<li>Giving a Technical presentation is tough. Its even worse if
you are speaking on topic that you are studying just for the
sake of the presentation.
</li>
<li>The presentations were rated as good, even if I know they were
no where close to what a Real Presentation should be like. POM
– bcos Ma'am thought we used the journal she gave us!! ThoR
– to encourage us to put in greater efforts.
</li>
<li>I'm not very good at giving presentations…
</li>
