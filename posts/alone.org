i am feeling terribly alone
i feel like i did never before
and this poem, therefore...

is it cos a friend's gone
to return, never again?
but there are others around
and of them, i'm proud

is it cos i'm away
from home, sweet home?
but its been quite a long stay
and i never felt so lonely...

i wonder why, then
do i feel terribly alone.

btw

1) one of the rare occasions, when I felt like writing a poem.[obviously, something is seriously wrong.]

2) you may choose not to call it a poem

*Update:* I found this during my not-so-random-blog-walks.

“..Alone is not a bad way to be;

it clears your head and focuses you on the journey.

Cherish the short intervals during the quest you have with others,

but be prepared to walk alone in the darkness.”[11/05/07]

*Update:* Interesting quote from a story...

“... no one is never really alone. Even when there is not other perso around, there still must be someone. Someone who made you  and therefore cares what happens to you. Someone who will help you if you do the best you can. So you're never alone. You can't be alone, no matter what you do. That's the secret of happiness, of doing things well, of everything...”
