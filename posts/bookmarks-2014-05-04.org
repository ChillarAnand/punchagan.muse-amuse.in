  The notion that it’s too late to do anything is comical. It’s
  hilarious. We’re graduating college. We’re so young. We can’t, we
  MUST not lose this sense of possibility because in the end, it’s all
  we have.

  We don’t have a word for the opposite of loneliness, but if we did,
  I’d say that’s how I feel at Yale. How I feel right now. Here. With
  all of you. In love, impressed, humbled, scared. And we don’t have
  to lose that.

  We’re in this together, 2012. Let’s make something happen to this
  world.

  not to allow them to be.
