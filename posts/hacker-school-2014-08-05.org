- Spent a couple of hours in the morning, trying to revive a html template for
  blaggregator, that I missed out on committing previously, and wiped out due
  to negligence in using `git clean`.
- Spent time post lunch working through the first two chapters of the baking pi
  course, by myself, reading up different references, and finally getting how
  I/O is mapped to the memory in ARM.
- Actually, almost.  A variant of the example that I thought should work,
  doesn't.  So, I need to think/talk about it today.
- I sent a patch to Nikola for the lastdeploy timestamp being UTC.  I was
  hoping to work around an [[https://github.com/sursh/blaggregator/issues/56][issue]] with Blaggregator, by somehow fixing it on the
  client side, but that's probably not the right way to go about it.
