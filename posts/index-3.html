<p>
A few days back, a couple of friends and I were discussing, how
anything sells in India and how opening a restaurant is seemingly
an easy way to make some quick bucks.  But, now, I have a much
better plan to make some big money, may be not so quickly, but
definitely a lot more – at least by an order of magnitude.
</p>

<p>
Religion!  Nothing sells like it, in the land of snake charmers!
People will buy anything on offer.  This post gives the recipe for
turning a small temple in a <span class="underline">god forsaken</span> town, into a big place
of worship that "attracts" devotees from all over the country, if
not the world!
</p>

<p>
The first task would be to zero-in on a temple.  But before that,
let's define the kind of town we are interested in.  Ideally, the
town should be within a couple of hundred kilometers away from a
city with good transport connectivity and a population at around
one and a half million (There are about 20 such cities, in the
country).  The temple in question could piggy back on the fame of
a temple nearby, if it is within about 50 kilometers of a really
famous temple, but in that case, our temple would remain the
second preference, for a very long time to come.  But this is much
easier to accomplish and arguably a quicker buck.  Ideally,
though, we'd prefer a location, which doesn't have any other
famous temples in the radius of about 300 kms (roughly 5-6 hours
by road).  It also helps if the travel to the temple for the big
city is through the country side, giving a glimpse of the country
side that urban Indians can only dream of connecting, the life
that was once lived by their parents and grandparents, but they
now only get to see in the movies.  This will help us score some
points with the "educated and sophisticated" urban populace.
</p>

<p>
Now, the temple.  It should be the biggest or the only one in
town, though having smaller temples around helps in knitting more
tales around the temple.  The temple in question should be one,
that the locals have tremendous faith in.  You should be able to
find at least a dozen people who vouch for the miraculous power of
the gods in there, without trying too hard.  That should be good
enough, to get you going, and I believe this isn't too hard for
any random temple, anywhere in the country.
</p>

<p>
The gods.  It really doesn't matter who the god is.  He/she could
either be a generalist or a specialist and that would influence
the type of crowds coming in.  Your god can be as specialized as
you like, up to the extent of specializing in blessing people get
visas to the US.  Now, your god can either be an already well
known god, or a not so well known incarnation of a well known god,
or a new person who is soon to become god!  The first type is a
hard bet; the third option is somewhat high risk too, and you'll
really need to put your mind to it, to make it work.  The second
option is the easiest one.  It always helps to have some real
objects and places that can be associated with the god, and are
living proof that the god once lived here and used those things.
It really helps if you can give the devotees the feeling that they
are doing all the things that the god in question once used to do,
at the same places he/she used to do it.  Type-3 gods would work
well for this.
</p>

<p>
Spread the word.  This, obviously, is the most important part and
the hardest one too.  It's best to start with the word of mouth.
Start with family and friends and friends of friends and friends
of friends of friends (read as facebook-only-friends).  Pick the
more religious of the lot, encourage them to visit the place,
write and share blog posts/tweets/pictures/tales/stories and
whatever else, with them.  Encourage them to interact with the
locals.  I don't think it would be necessary to make any deals
with the locals.  They are smart enough, wherever you go!  You
need to actively market your god, until a critical mass of happy
devotees, has been reached.  A critical mass is reached, when
there are more people talking of their wishes coming true, than
there are people who are still waiting for their wishes to come
true.  This should be too hard given that, religious people tend
to believe that whatever happens, happens for the best and god has
better plans for them, than their own.  Slowly, you could coax one
of the better writers (who is also religious?) into writing a book
or two about your temple.  A couple of years after selling your
book, you should try and encourage one of the big TV houses to
make a teleserial based on the book, and that would be it!  Now,
you can sit back and relax.
</p>

<p>
While getting all of the above right is important, it is also
super important to work out things with the current priest, form a
temple trust, and manage other such things and to time all of it
perfectly.  This part of the plan is left as an exercise for the
reader.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, this is a much more fruitful exercise than setting
up a restaurant, since this helps a whole economy grow around the
temple.  A whole bunch of things crop up, near our small town.
Transportation grows by leaps and bounds, hospitals and schools
grow with the population, the local vendors start earning more and
get a better quality of life, and all that jazz.  I guess, you get
the drift.

If you aren't already aware of it, I'm one of those people who
goes around saying, "GitHub is my Facebook".  I spend quite a lot
of time on GitHub, browsing the work of various people, looking at
loads of interesting stuff that people built.  I keep jumping
between people pages and projects using the Watchers/Watching &amp;
Followers/Following pages.  This way, I do come across interesting
people and projects, but the SNR is too low.  I wanted a better
way to be able to see stuff, that I find interesting.  That's how
the idea for this Chromium app – GitHub Cue – was born.
</p>

<p>
@baali and I hacked on this, during the last few days and got it
working.  It works as follows, (from the README) —
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Scrapes all the descriptions of the repositories being watched
by the user.
</li>
<li>Key terms are extracted from this description text using the
Yahoo Term Extractor.
</li>
<li>A list of languages is obtained, based on the languages of the
repositories, the user if watching.
</li>
<li>GitHub searches are performed for a combination of 3 randomly
chosen languages and 5 random key terms.
</li>
<li>10 random repositories out of all these, are shown.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
This is a very simplistic algorithm, but works decently for my
purposes.  Ideally, I would've liked to use a Collaborative
Filtering algorithm, but I found the data to be too sparse, and
the amount of computation to be too much to be done on the fly.  I
wasn't really interested in pre-computing stuff and putting it
onto my server.  I settled down to the next best thing I could
think of.
</p>

<p>
I would appreciate any further ideas and suggestions.  Thanks!

Well, I'm not sure if it's worth writing about.  I conducted my
first org-mode workshop along with Prof. Venkatesh Choppella at
IIIT-Hyderabad.  It was a 3 hour demo+talk kind of a thing, with a
small audience of about 20 people, most of whom were new to
Emacs.
</p>

<p>
We covered almost all the aspects of Org-mode after giving a brief
introduction to Emacs.  Outlining and note-taking part was simple
and easy to understand, but the audience couldn't really
appreciate the part of keeping TODO lists and agendas and other
stuff.  I'm hoping, the reason was not me taking over from
Venkatesh.
</p>

<p>
I think the workshop should've been more hands-on and we should've
asked people to try out stuff on the spot, instead of showing off
the things possible with Emacs.  They probably would've
appreciated a few things better, that way.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, we will be doing more workshops on Org-mode and there
are surely somethings to take away from this one.  I hope at least
one of the participants, gets hooked to Org-mode.
</p>

<p>
The talk outline is here.

Thanks to Chaitu, I re-read Love Unvoiced a few times and
realized, I was trying to say too much. Here's another poem,
with one part of what I wanted to say. I will not be writing
newer poems, to say the other stuff. Perform your own Fourier

I teach (Science and Engineering) students and teachers to use
Python for their computational tasks.  I'm occasionally asked
this question or something similar.  I remember, it was not too
long ago, that I asked this question very often.  I asked
anybody who was more experienced than me, "How do I start
contributing (code) to FOSS?" and all the answers I got, were
very similar.  Also, my answer is not going to be radically
different.  But, I would still like to answer this question,
because -
</p>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All the answers I got, were from big-time, experienced
contributors.  I suspect, they only vaguely remember how it feels
to be just starting off.  But, I am just starting off and I think
my answer brings a slightly different perspective that would help
others<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.1">1</a></sup>.

</li>
<li>More than anything else, a reminder and reference for myself.  I
still have a long way to go.  I only have a handful of
contributions against my name (none of them earth shattering).  I
haven't (yet) done my 10,000 hours of programming nor have I
learned anything like half a dozen programming
languages.<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.3">3</a></sup>

I know how exciting the FOSS world seems, the first time we discover
it.  You are dying to contribute.  You want to contribute, Right
Now!  But you've no clue, what, where and how.  Relax.  Give
yourself time.  You've a lifetime ahead of you.  Explore.  Explore,
even more.  Play with things, Try out stuff, Break stuff, Spill
things all over the place.  Have fun!<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.4">4</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Given that you are reading this, I presume that, you do have access
to the Internet.  But, if you don't, it could turn an impediment to
your goal.  Easy access to a decent internet connection is a
prerequisite.
</p>

<p>
Learn a programming language, well<sup><a id="fnr.3.100" name="fnr.3.100" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.3">3</a></sup>.  By learning, I don't
mean getting familiar with the syntax or passing a bunch of exams.
Get familiar with the paradigms of the language.  Learn to think in
that language.  Write code that does something <b>real</b>, instead of
doing toy examples.<sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.5">5</a></sup>  Also, it helps know bits and pieces about the
history and evolution of the language.  This will give you a sense
of why some features are present (or absent) and will help you
program better, in that language<sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.6">6</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Some projects will definitely catch your eye, while you are
exploring.  Start using the ones that you need.  Follow them!
</p>

<p>
Start with using the bleeding edge <sup><a id="fnr.7" name="fnr.7" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.7">7</a></sup> software.  Bleeding edge
refers to the latest sources of the project, where the active
development is going on.  Given the continuous nature of software
development, using the latest source,
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>prevents you from wasting time on fixing bugs that have already
</li>
</ol>
<p>
been fixed and
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>lets you look at the latest changes being made and contribute
</li>
</ol>
<p>
effectively and easily
 Also, start following the project mailing lists – both the dev and
 the user lists, if they are separate.  The user-list discussions
 will help you discover functionality and possibly give you some
 chance to peek at the source code, too.  Don't be surprised or
 worried if you don't follow most of what goes on, in the dev-list.
 Be patient and keep at it.  You will learn a lot about the <i>what,
 why and how</i> of the project.  Also don't be afraid to look foolish
 there!  There wouldn't be one developer who doesn't have some
 embarrassing logs of stuff she said in public, in her initial days.
</p>

<p>
Slowly you'll start to learn the dynamics of the community – how
things function, the DOs and DON'Ts, etc <sup><a id="fnr.8" name="fnr.8" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.8">8</a></sup>.  Also, there's
a good chance that the project has an active IRC channel.  If it
does, hanging out there will give you more insights.  Contributing
to the documentation, is often a useful step before contributing
code.  Cleaning up the documentation or writing documentation, often
requires you to read the code and helps you understand it better.
</p>

<p>
Next, start <b>acting</b> on Bug reports (or tiny feature requests).
Start with trying to reproduce the bugs and sending confirmations.
Gradually, start looking at the source and trying to figure out
where the problem is.  Be patient, with this <sup><a id="fnr.9" name="fnr.9" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.9">9</a></sup> .  Once
you get comfortable with the code and the coding style, start
sending code snippets and comments, explaining what you think might
be the problem.  One fine day, you will be able to send a full
working patch!  But, before that don't hesitate to send partial
fixes.  You can learn a lot from the comments of the devs and
looking at how they finally fixed it.  Also, IRC could be a good
place to ask for help, if you are stuck and are looking for some
quick help, so you can move further.
</p>

<p>
In all of this, it helps if you have one (or a bunch of) favorite
<i>area(s)</i> or <i>module(s)</i> of the project, specially in a big project.
You should pounce upon any issues in your favorite area.
</p>

<p>
Participate in sprints.  It's not uncommon for projects to have
regular sprints.  Make it there <sup><a id="fnr.10" name="fnr.10" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.10">10</a></sup>!  Also, a couple of
developers may decide to meet up on a weekend and hack.  If it's
happening in your neighborhood, ask if you can join.  Don't be
surprised, if they shout out a big YES!  You will definitely learn a
lot, when there is help so close-by.
</p>

<p>
A <i>shortcut</i> would be to start your own project!  It is easier (in
some ways) to release your own code under a FOSS license, than
contribute to some of the existing projects.  You don't have to have
your code approved by the project leads, you don't need to mould
your code to fit the standards of the project, you don't have to
read and understand all the (relevant parts of the) existing code,
etc.  But all of this, definitely teaches you a lot.
</p>

<p>
As a beginner, I think it is important to solve your <b>own</b> problems,
problems that you care about (at least at that point in time).  Most
of the projects, started off with their developers wanting to solve
their own problems.  Only, incidentally, they solved some of the
World's problems, too!
</p>

<p>
Start small, though.  Don't start off with a project that aims to
replace Chrome or Firefox as the best browser, or an editor to
replace Vim or Emacs.  Writing extensions to your favorite software
could be a good place to start, for instance an Emacs minor/major
mode<sup><a id="fnr.11" name="fnr.11" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.11">11</a></sup>, a Chrome extension<sup><a id="fnr.12" name="fnr.12" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.12">12</a></sup>, etc.  Stand on the shoulders
of giants!
</p>

<p>
Also, take this as an opportunity to gain some of the skills that
would be useful, when you want to start contributing to others
projects.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Learn to use Version Control (Git + GitHub is awesome!)
</li>
<li>Learn to use build and setup tools.
</li>
<li>Learn about packaging and distributing your software.
</li>
<li>Learn how to license your code.
</li>
<li>Learn to Collaborate!
</li>
</ol>

<p>
All of this, I hope, would suffice to get your first contribution
in.  But, there are a few things that will help you in the long run.
</p>

<p>
Good English. Specially written communication, since that is how you
would be communicating, more often than not.  Fair or not, hackers
are known to be very particular about good communication.  I'm not
exaggerating when I say, what you say may be ignored even if it
makes perfect sense, if you said it in sloppy English.
</p>

<p>
Using a *nix would put you in some great company.  At the very
least, you save time when looking for solutions to known problems.
Using a good editor and learning to type quickly can be big
productivity gains.  You only get 24 hours a day!
</p>

<p>
An understanding of licensing issues, can come in handy, many a
times.

Happy Hacking!

Over the last two days, I hacked up my first Chrome extension.
I've been using Chrome only for the past couple of weeks or so and
I begin to like it, though some of the extensions aren't as mature
as I would've liked.
</p>

<p>
The original idea was floated by my friend,  Madhu, and Lee helped
me quite a bit, while I was working on it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
It is a simple extension, that shows pop-ups, whenever there is
an update in your GitHub "Wall" (yes, this is a Facebook world)
or News Feed as they call it.
</p>

<p>
After installation, you will need to save your <code>username</code> and
<code>token</code> for the extension to work.

<h2 id="sec-2">Where to get it?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Presently, you will need to get it from GitHub.
</p>

<p>
I might add it to the Chrome Web Store, once I see more people
using it.  I couldn't justify, to myself, paying the initial
one-time verification fee that Google asks for.

I accidentally came across the blog-post Git-powered wikis
improved - GitHub. And this particular paragraph caught my
eye:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The new editor has the capability to support every markup
language that GitHub Wikis support. If you're a fan of Markdown,
Textile, pod or RDoc, the function bar buttons (e.g. bold,
italic, underline, etc.) will now work. We've even written brand
new inline help for many of GitHub Wiki's supported markup
languages.
</p>

<p>
The language definitions the editor uses are JSON-based and easy
to edit. If you'd like us to support a markup language that we
don't currently support, Gollum, GitHub's wiki software, is
entirely open source – fork our code and send us a pull request
with changes that support your choice language.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I sent a quick patch for org-mode in the function bar, and it has
been accepted.  :)
</p>

<p>
If not anything more, I hope, at least a couple of curious people
will explore org-mode and find it useful.

Well, as you can see, I've changed my blog a bit.  I had been
trying to make it gel well with org-mode and looking for ways to
allow me to share arbit stuff with separate feeds for tags,
separate pages with independent feeds, etc.
</p>

<p>
I finally got around to tweaking the code of reprise to be able to
do this.  There are still a few things I would like to change, but
I'll make the changes gradually.  The looks are also straight from
uddigal's reprise, with a few tiny tweaks.  I hope it is alright
to be using it.  I really liked the theme.
</p>

<p>
Every tag now has a separate feed. <code>/tags/emacs.atom</code> will give
you the feed of <code>emacs</code> for instance. Also, I plan to have a
couple of more pages, one for all the interesting links I come
across and another for interesting quotes.  Both of these pages,
have their own feeds too (<code>quotes.atom</code> and <code>links.atom</code>).
</p>

<p>
In the spirit of minimalism, I got rid of comments.  I've been
looking for ways of having comments without all the javascript
cruft from disqus, but I didn't find any satisfactory way to do
this.  So, the site will have no comments.  You can write to me,
in case you've something to say to me.
</p>

<p>
Adios.
