  Here is an interesting exercise in grayscale image processing, The
  goal is to remove some (nearly) horizontal lines from a scanned
  image, so that it is not obvious that the lines were ever there. The
  image is a pencil drawing that has relatively light pencil marks
  over dark lines that were printed on a ruled pad. The subject is

  to cover all stages of a life (which is why you'll find children's
  books in here), and we didn't want the list to feel like
  homework. Of course, no such list can be comprehensive – our lives,
  we hope, are long and varied – but we talked and argued and sifted
  and argued some more and came up with a list, our list, of
  favorites.

  37signals likes to. Do whatever you want, whatever works best for
  you, what makes you the most comfortable and seems like the best
  idea. Do what you love.

  What's the worst that can happen? You'll fail?
