- Fridays are optional in Hacker School, and people are given help
  with preparation for job interviews.
- This week's exercise was a "know-your-language" type exercise and I
  decided to do it with Haskell, and confirmed the fact that I didn't
  know it too well. :)
- I spent the afternoon writing the blog-post on [[./oauth2-demystified.org][OAuth2]], and adding
  support for converting ditaa code blocks to png using Pygments.  It
  may not have been the best use of time, but anyway...
