    In writing. Don't use adjectives which merely tell us how you want
    us to feel about the thing you are describing. I mean, instead of
    telling us a thing was "terrible," describe it so that we'll be
    terrified. Don't say it was "delightful"; make us say "delightful"
    when we've read the description. You see, all those words
    (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying
    to your readers, "Please will you do my job for me."
