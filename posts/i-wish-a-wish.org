On a day, Wonderful,
'm filled with emotion
inexpressible
for, I think of
all that we share.

On a day that's Special,
for the World,
not just yet may be,
my heart rejoices
in the light you fill me with.

On a day, epochal
I just hope, you enjoy
all that the World's given
and celebrate for
all the difference you make
in the World of some.

On this day,
overwhelmed, with lots to convey,
silence, I choose,
for, it speaks louder than words.
I just say,
Happy Birthday, mate.

my 50th post; A poem, I wrote a few weeks ago; A poem or is it doggerel?;
Something I wrote for a chum, that gives me courage to write more.
