- I spent most of the day refactoring the code for the LED Bot, and am happy
  with the way it looks right now.
- My talk at Hack and Tell went OK.  I was distracted by [[https://github.com/damianavila/live_reveal][live_reveal]] not
  displaying properly on the smaller resolution, and not being able to mirror
  screens!
- There were a bunch of interesting talks presented by the
  others. [[http://comparea.org]], [[https://medium.com/@vijayp/of-taxis-and-rainbows-f6bc289679a1][Taxis and Rainbows]] were the most interesting
  ones for me.
