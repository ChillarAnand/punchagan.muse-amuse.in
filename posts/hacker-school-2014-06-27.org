- This Friday we worked on building our own URL shorteners.  It was a fun
  exercise, and I built one that is not persistent, in the two hours.  I worked
  on a not so important problem of having sorted query parameters, instead of
  the more important problem of having a persistent server.  Anyway, I should
  be building something that works, first, before trying to solve the more
  interesting problems.  At least on Fridays.
- I watched this old but interesting talk by Brandon Rhodes, titled [[http://pyvideo.org/video/276/the-mighty-dictionary-55][The Mighty
  Dictionary]], and played around with his [[https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon2010-mighty-dictionary/blob/master/figures/_dictinfo.py][_dictinfo]] module after-wards.
- I spent the rest of the evening reading up about Markov chains and Hidden
  Markov Models. I'm happy to finally understand what these terms mean, after
  seeing them being thrown around for so many years!
