  You are there for one reason - to train hard, and to focus on all
  the things you need to be doing right - stance, breathing, form,
  recovery, chalking up, everything - and do them right. Quit faffing
  around!

  A training session is about an hour long, of mostly lifting stuff
  and time between lifting stuff, where you recover. If this isn't
  what you do, sleeping in is a better option.

  The map, at that point, will just be data: a way for our phones,
  cars and who knows what else to navigate in the real world. Whose
  data will that be: Google’s? Ours? Our car company’s? It’s too soon
  to tell. But one thing seems certain, O’Reilly says. In the end,
  “the guy who has the most data, wins.”

  The next time you see an application you like, think very long and
  hard about all the user-oriented details that went into making it a
  pleasure to use, before decrying how you could trivially reimplement
  the entire damn thing in a weekend. Nine times out of ten, when you
  think an application was ridiculously easy to implement, you’re
  completely missing the user side of the story.

  The history of Goa is intrinsically linked to the many centuries of
  Portuguese presence and rule. Before the arrival of the Portuguese,
  most Goan houses were mostly made of mud and had a thatched
  roof. They faced inwards towards a central courtyard and had small
  windows, mostly devoid of ornaments.

  The Portuguese arrived in Goa in 1510 and brought with them a host
  of cultural and aesthetic influences from Europe and other
  places. Goans who travelled abroad also returned with ideas and
  influences from other countries that they incorporated into their
  houses.

  the high that playing Ultimate Frisbee gives me, is pretty damn
  unbeatable.

  “If you want to describe a specific person in detail, I cannot do it
  in a general scheme. There is a general scheme, but there are plenty
  of specific ramifications that drive you to be the person that you
  are. For a planetary system it is the same thing. That’s chaos:
  extreme sensitivity to tiny changes.”

  Why chase plastic for life?

  Love at First Flight is a documentary on ultimate, or rather, why
  people play ultimate. It is a documentary for non-players that tries
  to explain our passion for the sport that we love.
