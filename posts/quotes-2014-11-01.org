- I wanted to change the world. But I have found that the only thing
    one can be sure of changing is oneself. ~ Aldous Huxley

- The true voyage of discovery consists not of going to new places,
    but of having a new pair of eyes. — Marcel Proust (1871–1922)

- All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. — Edmund Burke
  

- "I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep
    fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course,
  the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we
  began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really
  were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these
  machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching
  them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I
  hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I
  hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible
  salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about
  computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to successful
  computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is
  intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first
  led up to it, that you can make it more." -- /Alan J. Perlis (April 1,
  1922-February 7, 1990)/

- Forgetting is like radiation: you cannot smell it, you cannot taste it, and
    when you finally notice the damage, it is already irreversible -- /Piotr
  Wozniack/

- "Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes" -- /Edsger Dijkstra/
