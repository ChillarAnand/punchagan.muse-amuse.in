how do you determine a need that isn't being fulfilled and might be
the basis for a project/business? Two ways. You could ask people
what problems they have that you might be able to help solve, or
(for introverts like me) examine what processes or services feel
needlessly difficult in your own life.

<p>
Dewey-Hagborg’s work is super interesting, not to mention searingly
contemporary. “It’s a very accessible way for the public to engage
with this new technology. It really brings to light how powerful it
is, the idea that a hair from your head can fall on your street and
a perfect stranger can pick it up and know something about it,” she
says, adding: “With DNA sequencing becoming faster and cheaper, this
is the world we’re all going to be living in.”

<p>
So many books, so little time. With this in mind, the Amazon Books
editors set out to compile a list of 100 Books to Read in a
Lifetime. We had a few goals when we started out: We wanted the list
to cover all stages of a life (which is why you'll find children's
books in here), and we didn't want the list to feel like
homework. Of course, no such list can be comprehensive – our lives,
we hope, are long and varied – but we talked and argued and sifted
and argued some more and came up with a list, our list, of
favorites.

<li>“To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart
  will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make
sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not
even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little
luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or
coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket — safe, dark,
motionless, airless — it will change. It will not be broken; it will
become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to
tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only
place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the
dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.” – <i>C. S. Lewis</i>
</li>

<li>Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care – not just
  of any great method that descends from the heavens. That these acts
are simple doesn't mean that they are simplistic; and it hardly
means that they are easy. They are nonetheless the fabric of
greatness and, more so, of beauty in any human endeavor. To ignore
them is not yet to be fully human.  – James O. Coplien, <i>Foreword
to Clean Code</i>

<li>“We are all in the same boat, in a stormy sea, and we owe each other

<p>
Any software project is a collaborative project. It has at least two
developers, the original developer and the original developer a few
weeks or months later when the train of thought has long left the
station. This later self needs to reestablish the context of a
particular piece of code each time a new bug occurs or a new feature
needs to be implemented.
</p>

<p>
Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can't
avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it to as
small as possible. Commit messages can do exactly that and as a
result, a commit message shows whether a developer is a good
collaborator.

<a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>

<p>
The best approach is more indirect: if you have the right sort of
background, good startup ideas will seem obvious to you. But even
then, not immediately. It takes time to come across situations where
you notice something missing. And often these gaps won't seem to be
ideas for companies, just things that would be interesting to
build. Which is why it's good to have the time and the inclination
to build things just because they're interesting.
</p>

<p>
Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it
sounds, that's the real recipe.

I was playing around with a few ideas for creating a timeline for the
mumbai ultimate group, and as a part of playing around with stuff, for
that idea, I ended up wanting to scrape all the emails on our google
group.  After looking around a little bit, I failed to find anything
that claims to be able to do this.
</p>

<p>
So I ended up writing my own <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/7947337">hacky script</a> to download all the emails
sent on the group.  Like I said, this is a hack and can be improved
quite a bit, but I am not inclined to do anything about it, right
now.  Since, everything about google groups is ajaxy, this script uses
selenium and does things on the page, that one would do by hand.  It's
not something that I am proud of, but it does the job!

Machine Learning (or ML) offers the promise of having a computer
pour through your data and automatically extract or create the
information that you’re interested in. At least in theory. On closer
inspection machine learning is a loosely defined collection of
poorly explained statistical and algorithmic tricks that are magical
when they work and fail fantastically when they don’t. Acquiring the
needed skills for working with data safely is not easy. So we’ve
assembled a solid set of suggestions and resources on getting
started.

What I learnt in my hunter-gatherer education has been far more
valuable to my adult life than what I learnt in school, and I think
others in my age group would say the same if they took time to think
about it.

Between The Great Backlash Against Waterfall Design and The Supreme
Acceptance of Agile Development, something was lost. Don't get me
wrong, waterfall design takes things way too far. Huge systems
specified in minute detail end up being the WRONG systems specified
in minute detail. We were right to strike it down. But what took its
place is too far in the other direction. Now we have projects with
short, badly written, or entirely missing documentation. Some
projects don't even have a Readme!
</p>

<p>
This is not acceptable. There must be some middle ground between
reams of technical specifications and no specifications at all. And
in fact there is. That middle ground is the humble Readme.

“If you let your mind talk you out of things that aren’t logical,
you’re going to have a very boring life. Because grace isn’t
logical. Love isn’t logical. Miracles aren’t logical.”
</p>

<p>
Barbra DeAngelis said that. And in one sweeping statement, she
summed up the entirety of what I’m trying to say here.

<p>
You are not your job, your relationship, where you live, where you
grew up, where you went to school, what you’re passionate about,
what you do or what you did or where you’re going or where you’ve
been. You just are. You are your existence, you are your awareness,
you are your consciousness.
