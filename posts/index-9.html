I came super early to try and get some work done in the quiet before
the daily checkins time.  Continued with the Haskell tutorial and
reading the Real World Haskell.
</p>

<p>
Finished a couple of exercises from the UPenn course, that were pretty
straight forward.
</p>

<p>
Also, finished a few exercises from chapter 3 of real world haskell,
and partially finished implementing Graham scan for generating a
convex hull for a set of points.
</p>

<p>
The exercises from both the places involved mainly learning about
Algebraic Data Types.
</p>

<p>
Mary pinged me to ask how the first couple of days were, and it was
good to talk to get a ping from her though I never talked to her.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to continue working on the Haskell exercises today.
</p>

<p>
I also got a couple of ideas for small projects:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since, yelp is blocked from here, nobody can use yelp's API and work
on any projects.  It may be helpful to have an API proxy server that
runs on a different server and forwards any requests coming to it.
</li>
<li>A simple script to create a twitter list for each batch of
Hacker School.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Doing them in Python would be pretty straight forward. I will try to
work on these things in Haskell, once I'm reasonably comfortable with
Haskell.

    <p>
Finally, I'm at Hacker School.  The day began with introductions,
breakfast and welcomes to HackerSchool.
</p>

<p>
The four rules of Hacker School were reiterated to all of us:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No (Feigning) surprise
</li>
<li>No Well-actuallys
</li>
<li>No Backseat driving
</li>
<li>No Subtle-isms
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was made clear that each of us should watch ourselves not to break
these rules, and being called on breaking these rules is totally cool,
and we should stop about it and think for a moment and move-on.
Breaking the rules doesn't make us bad hacker schoolers.  We are all
here to learn!
</p>

<p>
I liked the idea of all of us being asked to list out the things that
we are nervous about, and excited about.  I was happy to find that a
lot of the people were nervous about the similar kinds of things I was
nervous about.  I'm not alone!
</p>

<p>
After the check-ins, I started off with the Introduction to <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/">Haskell course</a> by
<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/">Brent Yorgey</a>.  What I did was mostly a recap of what I learned from the first
few chapters of <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">Learn you a Haskell</a>.  I learnt about how credit card numbers
are validated, apart from learning a little bit about lazy evaluation and
thunks.
</p>

<p>
The day ended with burritos and game night Mafia!

<a href="http://binchen.org/">Chen Bin</a> asked me to share my Nikola+Org work-flow, and share an
example post.

<p>
The org source for any post can be found by changing the URL of a post
from <code>.html</code> to <code>.org</code>.
</p>

<p>
I don't have much of a work-flow, because I don't post too often, but
here is what I typically do, to make a new post.
</p>

<p>
I start off by creating a new post using
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nikola new_post
</pre></div>

<p>
and then give the post a title and start editing the post in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
I have a simple snippet that lets me insert tags, based on existing
tags.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/6629020.js"></script><p>
Once I'm happy with the content of a post, I run <code>nikola auto</code> to
build the source and serve it locally, and see if the post "looks"
reasonable, after being rendered.
</p>

<p>
Once, I'm happy with it, I commit the post and deploy it using <code>nikola
deploy</code>.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># "rsync -rav output/* joe@my.site:/srv/www/site"</span>
<span class="c1"># And then do a backup, or ping pingomatic.</span>
<span class="c1"># To do manual deployment, set it to []</span>

At home, my video would always show a silhouette in G+ and Skype, and
I always thought that this was because the lighting at home was not
sufficient.  At office, the video was decent.  But, moving to sit
right under the light also didn't help much.
</p>

<p>
Struggling with a bunch of tools like <code>v4lctl</code>, <code>guvcview</code> didn't
help. But, during these struggles I noticed that <code>cheese</code> would show
me bright and cheerful, while all the other programs showed my
silhouette.
</p>

<p>
I set out to "fake" the output of <code>cheese</code> as a video device that
skype and other programs could use. But, I didn't have to go all the
way.  I ended up using <a href="https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback/">v4l2loopback</a> to create a loopback video device,
and just using <code>gst-launch</code> to redirect video to that device, did the
trick!  Thanks gstreamer!  Thanks v4l2loopback! :)

Git can be accurately understood as a fairly simple functional data

can see the ability to do version control as an emergent property of
using that data structure. I think talking about Git in this manner
will more accurately convey the simplicity and power of Git better
than any comparisons with centralized version control systems can
accomplish.

<p>
This post marks the beginning of what should develop to a series on
Python’s internals, I’m writing it since I believe that explaining
something is the best way to grok it, and I’d very much like to be
able to visualize more of Python’s ‘funky green gibberish soup’ as I
read Python code.

<p>
Not finishing your project doesn’t mean it’s not a success. It
depends what your goals are the for the project! I wrote an
operating system in Rust to learn, and I learned a ton. It’s not
finished, and it won’t be.
