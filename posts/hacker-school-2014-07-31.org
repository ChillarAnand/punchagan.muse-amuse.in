- I continued with doing the initial parts of the book, and didn't pair with
  Stephanie today.
- I gave a super-short presentation, introducing people to ~pdb~, IPython's
  ~tracer~.
- I just started writing a Bencoding parser in C, but I'm having trouble
  thinking about all the memory allocations and stuff.  It feels so
  nostalgic! :P
