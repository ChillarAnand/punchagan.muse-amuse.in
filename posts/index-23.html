This post is by Dominick Mills, coming to us, thanks to
Bloggerstock.  Dominick aka Lije blogs at Lije's Mindstate.  My post
on this month's Bloggerstock topic will appear at That Ain't Kosher.
</p>

<p>
And here is Dominick's post for you
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Hello world..today I'll be talking about a period in time I would like
to do-over, however I couldn't think of anything so I went in another
direction….I'd like to thank Bloggerstock and punchagan for
the opportunity leak my thoughts on this page….
</p>

<p>
I hope the readers understand that my views does not reflect those of
the host's page..before I get started though Let me take the time out
to explain what Bloggerstock is all about.  Bloggerstock is the
brainchild of a small group of bloggers who connected on 20SB. The
idea comes from the concept of a blog-swap in that maybe we could
create our own kind of event where we all wrote posts to be posted on
the next person’s blog. Essentially forming a blog-ring.
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of things in life everyone would like to relive and do
differently..I've been giving it some thought and it's been racking my
brain for the whole month now…I came to the conclusion that I have
nothing I'd like to really do-over…
</p>

<p>
My reason for this is that I wouldn't be this person I am…and I
wouldn't alter it in anyway…I love what I've become…if it weren't
for all the good and bad that occurred during my life time..I wouldn't
even be here writing this….or I wouldn't even have the same goals
and all my aspirations would be small…I know this all sounds weird
but giving the fact that I am a weird person, those who know me, this
is expected…I believe in things happening for a reason and without
these occurrences we'd be something totally different, and
</p>

<p>
maybe not becoming what we're suppose to be in life…sometimes we
look at situations and think, " Just maybe if I had done this… or
maybe if I hadn't…" even if my decisions had made into a bum on the
streets I think I would feel the same way…truth is we all have
regrets..learning to live with them is the hardest thing to do..we
tend to get caught up in the moment and want to relive those
things..either for the good or the bad…but we fail to realize that
it is those things that build character not for today but for our
tomorrows.
</p>

<p>
Whether it's falling for the wrong person, being back stabbed from a
friend, getting hoodwinked from a stranger, or missing out on an
opportunity….all of these are just life's lessons being taught..with
that being said you should never sulk over a decision we've made…in
the end we're our own cause of grief or happiness so don't whine about
it stuff that's happened….accept what has happened and move
forward…don't hold on to them, but don't forget them either…these
are turning points in our lives so appreciate them..
</p>

<p>
Well that's all I have to conjure up on the matter..though it kind of
went against the topic a bit but hey am stubborn lol.. once again I'd
like to thank punchagan for allowing me to feature on Rustic
Reverie and also Bloggerstock for providing me with the opportunity to
express myself on a fellow blogger's page.. here's a link to my page
to view my featured blog post

    <p>
Just back after attending PyCon India '10. It was not as exciting
as I hoped it would be.  That's generally the case with any
conference I attend.  (I guess, I expect too much from them. :P)
</p>

<p>
The keynote by David Goodger (pronounced like Badger :) was
"Good".  It was a very simple one talking of how to get Python
into the workplace.  His simple recommendation was to use Python
if we saw any opportunity where it could be used, without
bothering about permissions, convincing people etc.  "It's better
to ask for forgiveness, than for permission."  He spoke of myths
around Python – scripting language, dynamic language, too much
white space, toy language, nobody uses it.  He concluded the talk,
by saying mentioning Indian driving to be an indication of some
quick reflexes that we Indians have. ;) On the whole it was an
enlightening, humorous and enjoyable talk.
</p>

<p>
I didn't attend too many of other talks.  Amongst the ones that I
did attend, I particularly liked the one by Asim Mittal on using
the Nintendo Wii with Python.
</p>

<p>
On some thought about my experiences at conferences, I think
conferences shouldn't have any talks at all.  Or atleast, I
shouldn't be attending conferences for talks.  They are an excuse
to catch-up with people.  Conferences should have only lightning
talks of 10 mins and sprints.  Talks, with an extensive
explanation of stuff that can be easily found on the web, are a
waste of time.

Should one take the easy route of asking someone who knows, if she
is sitting right next to you? Or should we try and find out first,
before asking her? Should one value his time more than others' or
others' time more than his own?
</p>

<p>
Would we learn more if we tried to find out ourselves? Does
learning more, make sense? Is it worth spending the extra time?
</p>

<p>
I'm just talking of simple things that you could figure out by
spending a couple of minutes of searching the web or 5 minutes of
thinking or 10 minutes of reading a book.

I now have a GNU! I bought it (a GNU soft toy) in memory of my friend

As a bonus, I got the chance to have a photograph with just RMS and
me. Also, hoping the monetary contribution will be of some use to
FSF-India.

The thrill of getting the GNU (and the GNU itself) and shaking hands,
getting photographed with RMS is dedicated to all the lafoots and
specially to Voodoo, who taught me the meaning of the word "hacker".

We, Ritesh and I, finished our first 100+km ride – approximately
110km. Yo!

<h2 id="sec-2">The Story</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
We started at around 0720 and were hoping to reach Karnala Bird
Sanctuary by around 1130.  We — actually, soot covered clones of
us —  reached by about 1215 or so.  That's pretty decent,
considering we were directed to Karnala sports complex, when we were
looking for bird sanctuary and there was quite a bit of traffic near
Panvel.
</p>

<p>
While we were getting tickets to get into the sanctuary, a man was
amused by Ritesh's polka (dirt) dotted shirt and asks us whether we
rode down from JNPT.  We got all excited and told him, that we rode
down from Powai!  He just said, "Gone Mad!" and walked away, as if
madness was contagious.  Both of us, felt great!  We were high!  It
felt like the best compliment to get after a long, tiring,
(blackening) ride.  We got in and rushed to a tap and almost had a
bath under it.  The first touch of cold water was heaven!  Just a
while later, we got a shock.  We couldn't get any food near/inside
the sanctuary.  We will have to go back 3 km for that.  We spent
about an hour and a half, getting some oxygen, looking for a few
birds, giving up and settling with spiders and clicking some
pictures.  We got went back 3km to the hotel and spent about an hour
there (not all of it eating ;). We started back at around 1515.
</p>

<p>
The ride back was eventful.  We took a slightly different route,
tempted by a free Highway(NH4), waiting to be rode on.  The road
looked awesome, with a hill on the left, and no vehicles in sight.
But, as fate would have it, Ritesh's rear tyre gave way.  After some
search we found a guy fixing tyres of vehicles on the highway.  But
he refused to fix our bicycle.  He refused even to fill air in it,
so we could reach the nearest cycle repair shop.  After more search,
we found who agreed to fill air in the tyre. (It needs a special
valve pin.  The previous guy, probably didn't have it. But we
could've hacked up something.)
</p>

<p>
We rushed to Kalamboli and got the tyre fixed.  Then we headed back
in the route that we had come on.  It'd been raining on and off
through out the morning.  But first rain on the return only started
near Nerul.  It was a great relief.  My cycle started moving more
smoothly…  I loved it.  We got lost a bit near Ghatkopar.  Also,
the traffic was quite bad there. (Why do drivers get so bad, once it
starts raining?  It's not unique to Mumbai, but quite visible here.
We were back in Campus by around 2040.
</p>

<p>
Ritesh was energized after the puncture was fixed.  He rode like
crazy, after that.  The sole of my feet started hurting —
something like a cramp.  I don't know what exactly happened.  Also,
my groin was hurting quite a bit.  My only motivation at that point
was seeing Ritesh ride like crazy.  He was at his best, then!  I'm
still wondering where he got all that energy from.  It was a great
ride, for both of us!  Motivating each other to keep going. :)
</p>

<p>
Ritesh, where to next?

alphabetically and it ended up being the sorted order of the urls
and not the names. This function, when used with
<code>org-sort-entries-or-items</code> gave me what I wanted.

Thanks to benny (on #org-mode), I also learnt the difference
between <code>let</code> and <code>let*</code>.
