<li>Micheal demo-ed paredit mode in the emacs-club meetup, and I learnt a bunch
of things I didn't know about it.
</li>
<li>I added simpler tests (just one test, really) for <code>cinspect</code> using a dummy
module, and Tom started reviewing the code.  I wrapped up the code (for now),
until there is further interest in the project (in the form of issues/feature
requests).  I haven't yet announced it anywhere, but I probably should.
</li>
<li>I helped Teja (a friend of mine, not in HS) with a simple function to use
bisection to solve an equation.  He's just starting off with Python, and am
looking forward to see where he goes with it!
</li>
<li>I learned a few things about the V8 code base, thanks to sitting next to
Marcus, who is poking around with it.
</li>
<li>I started looking for other things to do, and went through a little bit of
the Audio programming book, but didn't do it for too long, until I stumbled
on <a href="http://greenteapress.com/complexity/">Think Complexity</a> and started reading it.  I read the introduction, and got
through a few of the exercises on Graphs.
</li>
<li>I also played around Flask-Sockets to help figure out answers to some
questions on Zulip, and was able to get a <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/53600958c1799c2dcf26">Hello World</a> working.
</li>
<li>In the process, I discovered the awesomeness of the gist-mode in emacs.  I
had always wanted gist plugins to let me list and update my previous gists,
but most of the plugins didn't seem to have it, or the feature wasn't very
discoverable.  I had tried writing something like that for Canopy, one or two
years ago.  Discovering that gist mode has this feature, was awesome!

the project.  But, he probably isn't that interested anymore since the code
base is Python2.x only.

<li>I didn't spend much time at Hacker School on Friday.  I reached a bit late
for the start of "Recursion day", and did a few problems.  The problems were
simple, but interesting.  After lunch, I headed home to start to Philly.
</li>
<li>Later in the day, I did some refactoring of the code to have the index reader
and writer split out.
</li>
<li>I also added a setup.py to be able to install the package using the standard
tools instead of PYTHONPATH hacks and stuff.
</li>
<li>During the refactoring, I again hit <i>this bug</i>.  I found out from Pankaj that
he has <code>from __future__ import print_function, absolute_imports</code> at the start
of his files these days.  I think I'm going to do it, too.

<li>Unicode issues: it turned out that (atleast) one of the files had a character
that wasn't UTF-8 encoded. I got around it by trying 'utf-8', if not falling
back to 'iso-8859-1'.  Now that I think about it, I should fallback to
'utf-8' with replace, if that doesn't work either.

<li>I did a little clean up on the way the indexes were stored, to be able to

<li>As preparation for a one-on-one this week with one of the facilitators, I was
wondering if I was really getting better as a programmer, by doing what I am
doing.
</li>
<li>I have heard at numerous places that reading and reflection are keys to
getting better. I feel like I haven't been giving these things much attention
in the past couple of weeks. I don't catch up on reading all the awesome
reading material shared on Zulip and I switched from writing this blog post
first thing in the morning, to any-time-after-lunch. I don't think this
worked out very well. Writing the post worked as a way to reflect on what I
had done yesterday, and what I should be doing today. So, I am back to
writing the blog post, first thing in the morning!
</li>
<li>Yesterday, I worked on indexing the Python sources in a way that the
inspection code can look up, later.  During this process, I found that my
code to use libclang's AST wasn't generic enough, and I had to clean it up to
be able to extract useful information from any file in the <code>cpython</code> sources.
</li>
<li>We also got to attend a super-awesome talk by <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Labnik</a>! He talked about
his progression from being an application developer, to writing libraries, to
working on languages (as a professional developer). He made a lot of
interesting and inspiring points during his talk.  Some of those that stuck
with me are:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>None of these is particularly harder than any of the other. Depending on
each person's personality, or the way their brain works, they are good at
doing one or the other.
</li>
<li>Getting good at programming is a matter of showing up, more than about the
"genes".  He repeated quite a few times that he disliked the idea of "baby
hacker", and left out the story of his childhood and college programming
days! I'm totally stealing his idea of meeting every saturday at 1pm, with
a bunch of friends and working until it was 10pm or so, when they could get
cheap beer and food!  And he did this all through his college!  It is
interesting that this idea is so similar to Hacker School!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was a very enjoyable and inspiring talk on the whole.
</p>
</li>
<li>The plan for today is to actually have the parsed information dumped into
some persistent format, and modify the inspect code to actually use it.
</li>
<li>I will also be pairing with Kyle for a few hours on working through some of
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book">http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book</a>

I took it easy during the weekend, and went on a nice camp with my a cousin's
family to TobyHanna State Park for a day or so, and spent the remaining (long)
weekend at their place in PA.  It was a pretty nice break!
</p>

<p>
Yesterday evening, I talked to Madhu about how ugly my code looked while I was
trying to use <code>libclang</code>, and he told me that he found a lot of wrapped C++/C
libraries end up being that way, and I also realized that using the Python AST
library seemed much cleaner, because it just contained Python objects, but
representing C/C++ objects in an AST and interacting with them in Python, isn't
that clean.
</p>

<p>
I cleaned up my code, and removed all the ugly regexes to use libclang to do
the parsing of the libs, and get the source code.  I basically got all the
tests passing, but they were taking an order of magnitude longer to run.  So, I
guess the next step is to cache things somehow.
</p>

<p>
I also added support for viewing the sources of built-in types.  It was pretty
simple, once I had everything working with libclang.

<li>I added a startup script in IPython, to monkey-patch it to use my code for

extensions</a>, and played around a little with <a href="https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/">pycparser</a>, but it didn't seem to
work too well with the Python's sources.
</li>
<li>I later went to the New York Public Library to see <a href="http://www.nypl.org/press/press-release/2013/06/26/new-york-public-library-display-historic-copies-declaration-independe">a copy of the Declaration

enable posting to different channels on zulip.
</li>
<li>I learnt a few things about Django.  Commented out references to views that
don't exists breaks templating.  Formsets didn't seem very convenient to use,
for editing data showing the user only partial forms.
</li>
<li>I played around with Clang for a bit, to try and use libclang to parse the C
code for inspection, instead of writing one myself.  It sometimes feels like
an overkill, but it feels like it'll make the whole code more robust.  I'm
not sure.  I'll need to play around for a bit more to decide.
</li>
<li>I also finally got around to fix the resolution of my tty shells.  I was in a
bus, and wanted my laptop's battery to last longer, and decided to use a tty
shell with just emacs running. But, the resolution sucked.  So, I
fixed. Essentially it involved removing a blacklist file that an old version
of Nvidia drivers left behind in
<code>/usr/share/grub-gfxpayload-lists/blacklist/</code> and setting
<code>GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080</code> in <code>/etc/default/grub</code>.
