  At Hacker School, I've been building an alternate universe Python by
  overwriting builtin functions and statements with Harry Potter
  spells.

  “The first time people come out for dark skies, and we get Bortle
  Class 1 and 2 here, it affects them deeply,” Carroll said. “They’re
  blown away. The connection with the stars is inside all of us, but
  it has been sequestered away.”

  Git can be accurately understood as a fairly simple functional data
  structure. Instead of explaining Git in terms version control, we
  can see the ability to do version control as an emergent property of
  using that data structure. I think talking about Git in this manner
  will more accurately convey the simplicity and power of Git better
  than any comparisons with centralized version control systems can
  accomplish.

  This post marks the beginning of what should develop to a series on
  Python’s internals, I’m writing it since I believe that explaining
  something is the best way to grok it, and I’d very much like to be
  able to visualize more of Python’s ‘funky green gibberish soup’ as I
  read Python code.

  Not finishing your project doesn’t mean it’s not a success. It
  depends what your goals are the for the project! I wrote an
  operating system in Rust to learn, and I learned a ton. It’s not
  finished, and it won’t be.
