- I spent most of the day working through David Beazly's tutorials on
  generators and coroutines, and it was mind bending.
- I learnt about ~send~ and ~throw~ methods on generators!  I hadn't heard of
  them before, and was totally surprised to come across them.
- I spent a little time late in the day getting class diffs working, and
  refactoring the api-diff tool to remove duplication of code between classes
  and modules. But, not very happy with the way I did it.
