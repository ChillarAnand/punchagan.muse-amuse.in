* C stuff
  - In the morning I cleaned up the code to open torrent files, and parse them.
  - I worked on a function to do encode text properly, and Sophia helped me
    find out that I had to use unsigned chars in it.
  - I looked at Sophia's threaded ftp server in C, and gave some suggestions on
    how the code could be refactored.

* Baking Pi
  - We still didn't get to the video stuff, yesterday.  We finished the first 5
    chapters, though, and have a SOS pattern display.
  - I'm really looking forward to doing the cool video stuff.

* Miscellaneous
  - William Skeith, gave a talk on [[https://github.com/wes1138/webauth-via-ssh][using SSH keys for web-authentication]], which
    was pretty interesting.
