When it comes to hacking on opensource software, none of age, gender, race, country of origin, or how you look matters. All that matters is a pleasant attitude to your fellow developers, a willingness to keep at it and learn as you go, the drive to not give up when things don't go your way, and the ability to tell the difference between an idea and the one who has it.

The neat thing about The Joel Test is that it's easy to get a quick yes or no to each question. You don't have to figure out lines-of-code-per-day or average-bugs-per-inflection-point. Give your team 1 point for each "yes" answer. The bummer about The Joel Test is that you really shouldn't use it to make sure that your nuclear power plant software is safe.

This article provides a detailed factual explanation of why
software is mathematics, complete with the references in

detailed factual explanation of why mathematics is speech,
complete once again with references. My hope is that it will help
patent lawyers and judges handling patent litigation understand
these fundamental truths, so they can apply that technical

<p>
I teach (Science and Engineering) students and teachers to use
Python for their computational tasks.  I'm occasionally asked
this question or something similar.  I remember, it was not too
long ago, that I asked this question very often.  I asked
anybody who was more experienced than me, "How do I start
contributing (code) to FOSS?" and all the answers I got, were
very similar.  Also, my answer is not going to be radically
different.  But, I would still like to answer this question,
because -
</p>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All the answers I got, were from big-time, experienced
contributors.  I suspect, they only vaguely remember how it feels
to be just starting off.  But, I am just starting off and I think
my answer brings a slightly different perspective that would help
others<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</li>
<li>This piece of writing is meant to be one comprehensive
compilation of things I want to share, if and when I'm asked
this question in the future<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
</li>
<li>More than anything else, a reminder and reference for myself.  I
still have a long way to go.  I only have a handful of
contributions against my name (none of them earth shattering).  I
haven't (yet) done my 10,000 hours of programming nor have I
learned anything like half a dozen programming
languages.<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.3">3</a></sup>

I know how exciting the FOSS world seems, the first time we discover
it.  You are dying to contribute.  You want to contribute, Right
Now!  But you've no clue, what, where and how.  Relax.  Give
yourself time.  You've a lifetime ahead of you.  Explore.  Explore,
even more.  Play with things, Try out stuff, Break stuff, Spill
things all over the place.  Have fun!<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>
Given that you are reading this, I presume that, you do have access
to the Internet.  But, if you don't, it could turn an impediment to
your goal.  Easy access to a decent internet connection is a
prerequisite.
</p>

<p>
Learn a programming language, well<sup><a id="fnr.3.100" name="fnr.3.100" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.3">3</a></sup>.  By learning, I don't
mean getting familiar with the syntax or passing a bunch of exams.
Get familiar with the paradigms of the language.  Learn to think in
that language.  Write code that does something <b>real</b>, instead of
doing toy examples.<sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.5">5</a></sup>  Also, it helps know bits and pieces about the
history and evolution of the language.  This will give you a sense
of why some features are present (or absent) and will help you
program better, in that language<sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.6">6</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Some projects will definitely catch your eye, while you are
exploring.  Start using the ones that you need.  Follow them!

Start with using the bleeding edge <sup><a id="fnr.7" name="fnr.7" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.7">7</a></sup> software.  Bleeding edge
refers to the latest sources of the project, where the active
development is going on.  Given the continuous nature of software
development, using the latest source,
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>prevents you from wasting time on fixing bugs that have already
</li>
</ol>
<p>
been fixed and
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>lets you look at the latest changes being made and contribute
</li>
</ol>
<p>
effectively and easily
 Also, start following the project mailing lists – both the dev and
 the user lists, if they are separate.  The user-list discussions
 will help you discover functionality and possibly give you some
 chance to peek at the source code, too.  Don't be surprised or
 worried if you don't follow most of what goes on, in the dev-list.
 Be patient and keep at it.  You will learn a lot about the <i>what,
 why and how</i> of the project.  Also don't be afraid to look foolish
 there!  There wouldn't be one developer who doesn't have some
 embarrassing logs of stuff she said in public, in her initial days.
</p>

<p>
Slowly you'll start to learn the dynamics of the community – how
things function, the DOs and DON'Ts, etc <sup><a id="fnr.8" name="fnr.8" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.8">8</a></sup>.  Also, there's
a good chance that the project has an active IRC channel.  If it
does, hanging out there will give you more insights.  Contributing
to the documentation, is often a useful step before contributing
code.  Cleaning up the documentation or writing documentation, often
requires you to read the code and helps you understand it better.
</p>

<p>
Next, start <b>acting</b> on Bug reports (or tiny feature requests).
Start with trying to reproduce the bugs and sending confirmations.
Gradually, start looking at the source and trying to figure out
where the problem is.  Be patient, with this <sup><a id="fnr.9" name="fnr.9" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.9">9</a></sup> .  Once
you get comfortable with the code and the coding style, start
sending code snippets and comments, explaining what you think might
be the problem.  One fine day, you will be able to send a full
working patch!  But, before that don't hesitate to send partial
fixes.  You can learn a lot from the comments of the devs and
looking at how they finally fixed it.  Also, IRC could be a good
place to ask for help, if you are stuck and are looking for some
quick help, so you can move further.
</p>

<p>
In all of this, it helps if you have one (or a bunch of) favorite
<i>area(s)</i> or <i>module(s)</i> of the project, specially in a big project.
You should pounce upon any issues in your favorite area.
</p>

<p>
Participate in sprints.  It's not uncommon for projects to have
regular sprints.  Make it there <sup><a id="fnr.10" name="fnr.10" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.10">10</a></sup>!  Also, a couple of
developers may decide to meet up on a weekend and hack.  If it's
happening in your neighborhood, ask if you can join.  Don't be
surprised, if they shout out a big YES!  You will definitely learn a
lot, when there is help so close-by.
</p>

<p>
A <i>shortcut</i> would be to start your own project!  It is easier (in
some ways) to release your own code under a FOSS license, than
contribute to some of the existing projects.  You don't have to have
your code approved by the project leads, you don't need to mould
your code to fit the standards of the project, you don't have to
read and understand all the (relevant parts of the) existing code,
etc.  But all of this, definitely teaches you a lot.
</p>

<p>
As a beginner, I think it is important to solve your <b>own</b> problems,
problems that you care about (at least at that point in time).  Most
of the projects, started off with their developers wanting to solve
their own problems.  Only, incidentally, they solved some of the
World's problems, too!
</p>

<p>
Start small, though.  Don't start off with a project that aims to
replace Chrome or Firefox as the best browser, or an editor to
replace Vim or Emacs.  Writing extensions to your favorite software
could be a good place to start, for instance an Emacs minor/major
mode<sup><a id="fnr.11" name="fnr.11" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.11">11</a></sup>, a Chrome extension<sup><a id="fnr.12" name="fnr.12" class="footref" href="/posts/i-love-foss-how-do-i-start-contributing-code.html#fn.12">12</a></sup>, etc.  Stand on the shoulders
of giants!
</p>

<p>
Also, take this as an opportunity to gain some of the skills that
would be useful, when you want to start contributing to others
projects.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Learn to use Version Control (Git + GitHub is awesome!)
</li>
<li>Learn to use build and setup tools.
</li>
<li>Learn about packaging and distributing your software.
</li>
<li>Learn how to license your code.
</li>
<li>Learn to Collaborate!
</li>
</ol>
<p>
All of this, I hope, would suffice to get your first contribution
in.  But, there are a few things that will help you in the long run.
</p>

<p>
Good English. Specially written communication, since that is how you
would be communicating, more often than not.  Fair or not, hackers
are known to be very particular about good communication.  I'm not
exaggerating when I say, what you say may be ignored even if it
makes perfect sense, if you said it in sloppy English.
</p>

<p>
Using a *nix would put you in some great company.  At the very
least, you save time when looking for solutions to known problems.
Using a good editor and learning to type quickly can be big
productivity gains.  You only get 24 hours a day!
</p>

<p>
An understanding of licensing issues, can come in handy, many a
times.

Happy Hacking!

The truth is, in the eleven plus years of my working life I’ve never worked at a software house, have never attended a computer class, and have no certifications. I wrote code through the ’90s, code and little else, telling everyone I was going to be a “software developer” when I grew up, and ultimately falling out of the academic system. But when it came to going to work, did I do the expected thing and join a software house? No, sir, I went into print publishing. What one does first sets the template, and this one sure did. I’ve put my foot into all manner of disciplines other than computer science, playing the saviour who produces the code, but bearing no certifications. I could afford it because I had put in my 10,000 hours already. After that much exposure, learning becomes automatic and incremental. I haven’t looked at a technology guide book in over a decade because I don’t need to. The book on my bedside today is on law. The one below it on film studies.

I can't really go into many specifics about what happened at Google
because of confidentiality, but the upshot was this: I saw, pretty
much for the first time in my life, people being as productive and
more in other languages as I was in Lisp.  What's more, once I got
knocked off my high horse (they had to knock me more than once – if
anyone from Google is reading this, I'm sorry) and actually bothered
to really study some of these other languges I found <b>myself</b>
suddenly becoming more productive in other languages than I was in
Lisp.  For example, my language of choice for doing Web development
now is Python.

Looking back at that time, the restrictions of the environment are
the biggest single factor in bringing out the best in the people
that worked with computers back then. Think of your programming
career as one endless code-golf competition trying to find a way to
get both your data and your code in memory at the same time

people paid me for something that I would have gladly done for free
