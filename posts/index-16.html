<a href="http://binchen.org/">Chen Bin</a> asked me to share my Nikola+Org work-flow, and share an
example post.
</p>

<p>
The org source for any post can be found by changing the URL of a post
from <code>.html</code> to <code>.org</code>.
</p>

<p>
I don't have much of a work-flow, because I don't post too often, but
here is what I typically do, to make a new post.
</p>

<p>
I start off by creating a new post using
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>nikola new_post
</pre></div>

<p>
and then give the post a title and start editing the post in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
I have a simple snippet that lets me insert tags, based on existing
tags.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/6629020.js"></script>

<p>
Once I'm happy with the content of a post, I run <code>nikola auto</code> to
build the source and serve it locally, and see if the post "looks"
reasonable, after being rendered.
</p>

<p>
Once, I'm happy with it, I commit the post and deploy it using <code>nikola
deploy</code>.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Commands to execute to deploy. Can be anything, for example,</span>
<span class="c"># you may use rsync:</span>
<span class="c"># "rsync -rav output/* joe@my.site:/srv/www/site"</span>
<span class="c"># And then do a backup, or ping pingomatic.</span>
<span class="c"># To do manual deployment, set it to []</span>
<span class="n">DEPLOY_COMMANDS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="s">'default'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
	<span class="s">'nikola deploy assert-fork'</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="s">'nikola orphans|xargs rm || true'</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="s">'git checkout master'</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="s">'nikola build'</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="s">'./commit-changes || true'</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="s">'nikola github_deploy'</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="s">'git push origin master'</span><span class="p">,</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
I also have a plugin, that posts captured bookmarks and quotes onto
the blog, with a single command. I should probably make the sources of
my blog open, and push it onto GitHub.

At home, my video would always show a silhouette in G+ and Skype, and
I always thought that this was because the lighting at home was not
sufficient.  At office, the video was decent.  But, moving to sit
right under the light also didn't help much.
</p>

<p>
Struggling with a bunch of tools like <code>v4lctl</code>, <code>guvcview</code> didn't
help. But, during these struggles I noticed that <code>cheese</code> would show
me bright and cheerful, while all the other programs showed my
silhouette.
</p>

<p>
I set out to "fake" the output of <code>cheese</code> as a video device that
skype and other programs could use. But, I didn't have to go all the
way.  I ended up using <a href="https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback/">v4l2loopback</a> to create a loopback video device,
and just using <code>gst-launch</code> to redirect video to that device, did the
trick!  Thanks gstreamer!  Thanks v4l2loopback! :)

<p>
Here's a convenient <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/9859210">script</a> to use it every time I need it.

    <p>
I was playing around with a few ideas for creating a timeline for the
mumbai ultimate group, and as a part of playing around with stuff, for
that idea, I ended up wanting to scrape all the emails on our google
group.  After looking around a little bit, I failed to find anything
that claims to be able to do this.
</p>

<p>
So I ended up writing my own <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/7947337">hacky script</a> to download all the emails
sent on the group.  Like I said, this is a hack and can be improved
quite a bit, but I am not inclined to do anything about it, right
now.  Since, everything about google groups is ajaxy, this script uses
selenium and does things on the page, that one would do by hand.  It's
not something that I am proud of, but it does the job!

It was a pleasant Saturday evening, in the middle of the winter.
Christmas was just round the corner and love, in the air. The sun was
just setting, and everything outside his window was given a fresh coat
of snow, tickled by the red, quickly fading light. Not that he
noticed. He stared blankly out of the window, looking at nothing in
particular. He had just woke up from his afternoon nap, but he'd buy
it, if you told him he'd been sleeping for a year…
</p>

<p>
You could see the icy river, crawling ahead, from his window.  People
walking over the bridge, a few camera flashes going off, people
stopping over and looking far ahead into the horizon, collecting their
thoughts, couples walking hand-in-hand enjoying each others'
company… You could see it all, from up there! But, as they say, you
only see what you look for. And he, couldn't see any of this. His
looked out of his window, and saw none of this.
</p>

<p>
He is walking down the same bridge. He didn't know where he was going;
his head at least. His legs did; as always. He was walking down in his
regular yellow shirt and black jeans, that you could mistake for a
uniform, if you followed him for a few days. Extremely under-dressed
for the chilly night, one would say. He kept walking down the main
street, lined with shops brightly lit up for the festive season. The
pavement bustled with with people walking with a spring in their step
– the spring that the festive season, and all the love in the air
brought to you. Not that he noticed it, or had any of it in his step.
</p>

<p>
Soon, he's walking through the park. The park that was built to
celebrate time, ticking away, furiously. Or to celebrate the time
everyone in the world had, to enjoy themselves. He walked past the
skating rink, with lots of people having the time of their life ice
skating, and a lot more, awaiting their turn. The first timers, old
and young, making up for their inexperience, with their excitement;
holding onto whatever they can, to finish their next round, to start
their next. The veterans, taking the center-stage and showing off
their moves! He was barely aware of their presence and just walked on,
past all the action.
</p>

<p>
The music festival; he walked past it to, like the crowd didn't exist,
the noise didn't, the music didn't; like there was nothing happening!
The fountain "felt" no different. The cold breeze, did sprinkle the
water to quite a distance and everybody kept a safe distance to avoid
the chilling shower, except for the kids, who found it amusing to run
into the shower for a split second and run back madly. How could he
walk just by it, and not feel a thing!
</p>

<p>
The lakefront. That is where his legs always brought him, at the
end. The brilliantly lit skyline was a delight to watch, but I don't
believe he saw any of it. He just stared into it, blankly. He kept
staring, as the night got chillier, and the neighborhood kept getting
more and more deserted. Seconds ticked away, minutes and hours passed
by! He stayed on, staring ahead. It didn't matter how much below zero
the mercury had gone. This wasn't the first night he was spending
staring into the nothingness. It turned out to be the coldest night,
in a decade. But that didn't matter to him. Nothing did. Nothing has,
for a while now; Ever since he turned cold.
