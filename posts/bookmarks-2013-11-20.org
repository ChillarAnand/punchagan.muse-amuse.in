  The biggest trap that you can fall into is if you can be successful
  without giving your 100 percent in whatever you are doing.

  Here's my advice for Lucy:

  1) Stay wildly ambitious. The current world is bubbling with
     opportunity for an ambitious person to find flowery, fulfilling
     success. The specific direction may be unclear, but it'll work
     itself out -- just dive in somewhere.

  2) Stop thinking that you're special. The fact is, right now, you're
     not special. You're another completely inexperienced young person
     who doesn't have all that much to offer yet. You can become
     special by working really hard for a long time.

  3) Ignore everyone else. Other people's grass seeming greener is no
     new concept, but in today's image crafting world, other people's
     grass looks like a glorious meadow. The truth is that everyone
     else is just as indecisive, self-doubting, and frustrated as you
     are, and if you just do your thing, you'll never have any reason
     to envy others.

  Python’s standard logging package is a really wonderful thing, but
  unfortunately some of its key ideas aren’t clearly documented in a
  large enough point font.

  Code review is an important part of a healthy engineering culture
  and workflow. Hopefully, this post has given you an idea of either
  how to implement it for your team, or how to improve your existing
  workflow.
