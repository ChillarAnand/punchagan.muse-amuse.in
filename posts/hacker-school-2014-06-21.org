- I spent most of Saturday, thinking about what I should be doing for
  the next few weeks, and what I really want to get out of Hacker
  School.
- I had a good discussion with Naren about things that he works on,
  and the kind of things that he sees as hard, what kind of things
  interest me, and what I want to do post Hacker School.  I always
  knew, I didn't really have an area of expertise or an area that I'm
  super interested in, where I want to work.  This discussion only was
  a verbalizing of those thoughts.
- I am not sure, I am very happy with the way I have been learning
  Haskell.  The UPenn course has been reasonably good with the
  exercises provided, and I have been learning through "pseudo"
  projects.  But, I'm wondering if I should pick up a more concrete
  project.
- I played around a little bit with Elm and started something to try
  and write [[https://github.com/huckerdom/layout][Layout]] using Elm.
- I tried cleaning up the phonebook problem from Friday. It works, but
  can definitely be improved with some help from a more experienced
  Haskeller.
