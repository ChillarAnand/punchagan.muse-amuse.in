- I added an additional view to xtab, to see all the pages that were killed,
  and reopen them, if you so choose.
- Also, cleaned up the ~api-diff~ project and renamed it to [[https://github.com/punchagan/what-changed][what-changed]].
- Started thinking about building the GitHub organization dashboard, that I
  thought would be interesting to have, since the 1st or 2nd week of Hacker
  School.
- A bunch of awesome thursday presentations, and job fair and awesome food by
  Chef Warren!
