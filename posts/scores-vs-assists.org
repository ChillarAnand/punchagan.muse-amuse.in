Write your post here.

for scores you can go and see your resume or something.. because people care
abotu it, you care to list things down for them. even here, some of them could
go unnoticed or whatever..

when you are feeling down, looking at your assists could be good.

do we hire people with good assists?  or just scoring skills?

are we not trying to build teams?  reminds me of stripe's experimental hiring.

why is there such a low incentive for assists?


mentors, thank you notes, whatever.

human touch. whatever.  I don't know...  Don't be so afraid of writing things
down. :)
