<p>
Machine Learning (or ML) offers the promise of having a computer
pour through your data and automatically extract or create the
information that you’re interested in. At least in theory. On closer
inspection machine learning is a loosely defined collection of
poorly explained statistical and algorithmic tricks that are magical
when they work and fail fantastically when they don’t. Acquiring the
needed skills for working with data safely is not easy. So we’ve
assembled a solid set of suggestions and resources on getting
started.

What I learnt in my hunter-gatherer education has been far more
valuable to my adult life than what I learnt in school, and I think
others in my age group would say the same if they took time to think
about it.

<p>
Between The Great Backlash Against Waterfall Design and The Supreme
Acceptance of Agile Development, something was lost. Don't get me
wrong, waterfall design takes things way too far. Huge systems
specified in minute detail end up being the WRONG systems specified
in minute detail. We were right to strike it down. But what took its
place is too far in the other direction. Now we have projects with
short, badly written, or entirely missing documentation. Some
projects don't even have a Readme!
</p>

<p>
This is not acceptable. There must be some middle ground between
reams of technical specifications and no specifications at all. And
in fact there is. That middle ground is the humble Readme.

“If you let your mind talk you out of things that aren’t logical,
you’re going to have a very boring life. Because grace isn’t
logical. Love isn’t logical. Miracles aren’t logical.”

Barbra DeAngelis said that. And in one sweeping statement, she
summed up the entirety of what I’m trying to say here.

<p>
You are not your job, your relationship, where you live, where you
grew up, where you went to school, what you’re passionate about,
what you do or what you did or where you’re going or where you’ve
been. You just are. You are your existence, you are your awareness,
you are your consciousness.

You are there for one reason - to train hard, and to focus on all
the things you need to be doing right - stance, breathing, form,
recovery, chalking up, everything - and do them right. Quit faffing
around!
</p>

<p>
A training session is about an hour long, of mostly lifting stuff
and time between lifting stuff, where you recover. If this isn't
what you do, sleeping in is a better option.

The map, at that point, will just be data: a way for our phones,

to tell. But one thing seems certain, O’Reilly says. In the end,
“the guy who has the most data, wins.”

The next time you see an application you like, think very long and
hard about all the user-oriented details that went into making it a
pleasure to use, before decrying how you could trivially reimplement
the entire damn thing in a weekend. Nine times out of ten, when you
think an application was ridiculously easy to implement, you’re
completely missing the user side of the story.

<a href="http://housesofgoa.com/about.html">Houses of Goa - About the Project</a>

<p>
The history of Goa is intrinsically linked to the many centuries of
Portuguese presence and rule. Before the arrival of the Portuguese,
most Goan houses were mostly made of mud and had a thatched
roof. They faced inwards towards a central courtyard and had small
windows, mostly devoid of ornaments.
</p>

<p>
The Portuguese arrived in Goa in 1510 and brought with them a host
of cultural and aesthetic influences from Europe and other
places. Goans who travelled abroad also returned with ideas and
influences from other countries that they incorporated into their
houses.

“If you want to describe a specific person in detail, I cannot do it

Born of human error, continually generating copious heat, the
Elephant’s Foot is still melting into the base of the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant. If it hits ground water, it could trigger
another catastrophic explosion or leech radioactive material into
the water nearby residents drink. Long after bleeding from the core,
this unique piece of waste continues to be a testament to the
potential dangers of nuclear power. The Elephant’s Foot will be
there for centuries, sitting in the dark basement of a concrete and

tools gone awry.

I told you before that the purpose of mathematics is insight, but I
think I lied. Even more than that, the reason I do math is the
excitement and uncertainty of the chase. There is no joy in applying
a computer algorithm, but there is joy in unlocking the delicate
clockwork mechanism that makes a good math problem tick. And, in the
end, you just might learn something that nobody else in the world
knows!

<p>
… Oh, and by the way, I really don’t believe that honesty is merely
a wasted opportunity to cheat. I said that just for effect. Honest.

mix up a Rubik’s cube. You show the cube to your computer’s

the cube begins to solve itself, and all you have to do is follow
along and you will have solved your cube!

Event time is very different. Time is not so tangible, and certainly
not equivalent to money. Attending to relationships is more
important than attending to the clock.

Cognitive Science at Carleton University, I have developed several

summarized the changes in the Python 2.x releases. Today when I
showed it to someone, they asked, "Do you have one for 3.x?"

As we prepare body and soul for the gluttony and giving nearly upon
us, Jason Silva presents us with an intellectual antidote; an
incredible and excitable selection of books that thinks a little
bigger than exactly how many brussels sprouts we will be expected to
eat in the coming weeks. Web-wide courted themes of The Singualrity,
group consciousness and technology’s expectation of us, the
synthesis of the human condition and (why not?) immortality – all
are to be found in the permanent pages of this wonderfully
accessible selection of books on Silva’s Bookshelf.

Here's my advice for Lucy:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Stay wildly ambitious. The current world is bubbling with
opportunity for an ambitious person to find flowery, fulfilling
success. The specific direction may be unclear, but it'll work
itself out – just dive in somewhere.
</li>

<li>Stop thinking that you're special. The fact is, right now, you're
not special. You're another completely inexperienced young person
who doesn't have all that much to offer yet. You can become
special by working really hard for a long time.
</li>

<li>Ignore everyone else. Other people's grass seeming greener is no
new concept, but in today's image crafting world, other people's
grass looks like a glorious meadow. The truth is that everyone
else is just as indecisive, self-doubting, and frustrated as you
are, and if you just do your thing, you'll never have any reason
to envy others.
