Born of human error, continually generating copious heat, the
Elephant’s Foot is still melting into the base of the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant. If it hits ground water, it could trigger
another catastrophic explosion or leech radioactive material into
the water nearby residents drink. Long after bleeding from the core,
this unique piece of waste continues to be a testament to the
potential dangers of nuclear power. The Elephant’s Foot will be
there for centuries, sitting in the dark basement of a concrete and

I told you before that the purpose of mathematics is insight, but I
think I lied. Even more than that, the reason I do math is the
excitement and uncertainty of the chase. There is no joy in applying
a computer algorithm, but there is joy in unlocking the delicate
clockwork mechanism that makes a good math problem tick. And, in the
end, you just might learn something that nobody else in the world
knows!

mix up a Rubik’s cube. You show the cube to your computer’s

the cube begins to solve itself, and all you have to do is follow
along and you will have solved your cube!

Here's my advice for Lucy:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Stay wildly ambitious. The current world is bubbling with
opportunity for an ambitious person to find flowery, fulfilling
success. The specific direction may be unclear, but it'll work
itself out – just dive in somewhere.
</li>

<li>Stop thinking that you're special. The fact is, right now, you're
not special. You're another completely inexperienced young person
who doesn't have all that much to offer yet. You can become
special by working really hard for a long time.
</li>

<li>Ignore everyone else. Other people's grass seeming greener is no
new concept, but in today's image crafting world, other people's
grass looks like a glorious meadow. The truth is that everyone
else is just as indecisive, self-doubting, and frustrated as you
are, and if you just do your thing, you'll never have any reason
to envy others.

Python’s standard logging package is a really wonderful thing, but
unfortunately some of its key ideas aren’t clearly documented in a
large enough point font.

<p>
Code review is an important part of a healthy engineering culture
and workflow. Hopefully, this post has given you an idea of either
how to implement it for your team, or how to improve your existing
workflow.

<p>
The engineering metaphor has had its time in the sun, and maybe it
even used to be accurate, but now it really only serves to help
non-technical people have unrealistic expectations about how
software gets built.

<p>
When Craig Lewis aged 55 had been diagnosed with a heart disease so
intricate not even a pacemaker could save him, Texan doctors had to
think outside of the box.
</p>

<p>
Outstandingly, they developed a revolutionary concept where by they
install a device that keeps his blood in continuous flow…without a
pulse.

<p>
Within a day of surgery Craig was up and speaking to doctors and now
lives fully functioning without a heart. Who said science was
boring?

    <p>
It was a pleasant Saturday evening in the middle of the winter. Christmas was
just round the corner and love in the air. The sun was just setting and
everything outside his window was given a fresh coat of snow, tickled by the
red, quickly fading light. Not that he noticed. He stared blankly out of the
window, looking at nothing in particular. He had just woken up from his
afternoon nap; but he'd buy it if you told him he'd been sleeping for a year…
</p>

<p>
You could see the icy river crawling ahead, from his window.  People walking
over the bridge, a few camera flashes going off, people stopping over and
looking far ahead into the horizon – collecting their thoughts, couples
walking hand-in-hand enjoying each others' company; You could see it all, from
up there! But, as they say, you only see what you look for. And he, couldn't
see any of this. His looked out of his window and saw none of this.
</p>

<p>
He is walking down the same bridge. He didn't know where he was going; his head
at least. His legs did; as always. He was walking down in his regular yellow
shirt and black jeans, that you could mistake for a uniform, if you followed
him for a few days. Extremely under-dressed for the chilly night, one would
say. He kept walking down the main street, lined with shops brightly lit up for
the festive season. The pavement bustled with with people walking with a spring
in their step – the spring that the festive season and all the love in the air
brought to you. Not that he noticed it, or had any of it in his step.
</p>

<p>
Soon, he's walking through the park. The park that was built to celebrate time,
ticking away furiously. Or to celebrate the time everyone in the world had, to
enjoy themselves. He walked past the skating rink, with lots of people having
the time of their life, ice skating; and a lot more, awaiting their turn. The
first timers, old and young, making up for their inexperience, with their
excitement; holding onto whatever they can, to finish each round, to start the
next! The veterans, taking the center-stage and showing off their moves!  He
was barely aware of their presence and just walked on, past all the action.
</p>

<p>
The music festival; he walked past it too, like the crowd didn't exist, the
noise didn't, the music didn't; like there was nothing happening! The fountain
"felt" no different. The cold breeze, did sprinkle the water to quite a
distance and everybody kept a safe distance to avoid the chilling shower,
except for the kids, who found it amusing to run into the shower for a split
second and run back madly. How could he walk just by it, and not feel a thing!
</p>

<p>
The lakefront. That is where his legs always brought him in the end. The
brilliantly lit skyline was a delight to watch, but I don't believe he saw any
of it. He just stared into it, blankly. He kept staring, as the night got
chillier and the surroundings kept getting more and more deserted. Seconds
ticked away, minutes and hours passed by! He stayed on, staring ahead. It
didn't matter how much below zero the mercury had gone. This wasn't the first
night he was spending staring into the nothingness. It turned out to be the
coldest night, in a decade. But that didn't matter to him. Nothing did. Nothing
has, for a while now; Ever since he turned cold.
