Here's my advice for Lucy:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Stay wildly ambitious. The current world is bubbling with
opportunity for an ambitious person to find flowery, fulfilling
success. The specific direction may be unclear, but it'll work
itself out – just dive in somewhere.
</li>

<li>Stop thinking that you're special. The fact is, right now, you're
not special. You're another completely inexperienced young person
who doesn't have all that much to offer yet. You can become
special by working really hard for a long time.
</li>

<li>Ignore everyone else. Other people's grass seeming greener is no
new concept, but in today's image crafting world, other people's
grass looks like a glorious meadow. The truth is that everyone
else is just as indecisive, self-doubting, and frustrated as you
are, and if you just do your thing, you'll never have any reason
to envy others.

    <p>
It was a pleasant Saturday evening in the middle of the winter. Christmas was
just round the corner and love in the air. The sun was just setting and
everything outside his window was given a fresh coat of snow, tickled by the
red, quickly fading light. Not that he noticed. He stared blankly out of the
window, looking at nothing in particular. He had just woken up from his
afternoon nap; but he'd buy it if you told him he'd been sleeping for a year…
</p>

<p>
You could see the icy river crawling ahead, from his window.  People walking
over the bridge, a few camera flashes going off, people stopping over and
looking far ahead into the horizon – collecting their thoughts, couples
walking hand-in-hand enjoying each others' company; You could see it all, from
up there! But, as they say, you only see what you look for. And he, couldn't
see any of this. His looked out of his window and saw none of this.
</p>

<p>
He is walking down the same bridge. He didn't know where he was going; his head
at least. His legs did; as always. He was walking down in his regular yellow
shirt and black jeans, that you could mistake for a uniform, if you followed
him for a few days. Extremely under-dressed for the chilly night, one would
say. He kept walking down the main street, lined with shops brightly lit up for
the festive season. The pavement bustled with with people walking with a spring
in their step – the spring that the festive season and all the love in the air
brought to you. Not that he noticed it, or had any of it in his step.
</p>

<p>
Soon, he's walking through the park. The park that was built to celebrate time,
ticking away furiously. Or to celebrate the time everyone in the world had, to
enjoy themselves. He walked past the skating rink, with lots of people having
the time of their life, ice skating; and a lot more, awaiting their turn. The
first timers, old and young, making up for their inexperience, with their
excitement; holding onto whatever they can, to finish each round, to start the
next! The veterans, taking the center-stage and showing off their moves!  He
was barely aware of their presence and just walked on, past all the action.
</p>

<p>
The music festival; he walked past it too, like the crowd didn't exist, the
noise didn't, the music didn't; like there was nothing happening! The fountain
"felt" no different. The cold breeze, did sprinkle the water to quite a
distance and everybody kept a safe distance to avoid the chilling shower,
except for the kids, who found it amusing to run into the shower for a split
second and run back madly. How could he walk just by it, and not feel a thing!
</p>

<p>
The lakefront. That is where his legs always brought him in the end. The
brilliantly lit skyline was a delight to watch, but I don't believe he saw any
of it. He just stared into it, blankly. He kept staring, as the night got
chillier and the surroundings kept getting more and more deserted. Seconds
ticked away, minutes and hours passed by! He stayed on, staring ahead. It
didn't matter how much below zero the mercury had gone. This wasn't the first
night he was spending staring into the nothingness. It turned out to be the
coldest night, in a decade. But that didn't matter to him. Nothing did. Nothing
has, for a while now; Ever since he turned cold.

I have triggered an involuntary "forced push" last night on the list
of Jenkins-CI plugins indicated below in this e-mail.

The total number of impacted repositories should then be: 186

<a href="http://twitter.com/avudem">Voodoo</a> found a broken link referring to a one of my posts, on Quora.
Given that I have changed my site generator a bunch of times now, it
is quite possible that there are other broken links at various other
places.  So, I implemented a smart <a href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/this-is-a-fun-hack">404 page</a> for the site, yesterday.
It is very similar to something I came across on <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/04/07/fun-with-intelligent-404-pages/">brettterpstra</a>'s site.
I just <a href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/assets/js/suggestions.js">hooked up</a> <a href="http://kiro.me/projects/fuse.html">fuse.js</a> with Nikola's <a href="http://getnikola.com/handbook.html#local-search">tipue-search plugin</a>'s output
file.  My glue code essentially, just figures out the search term from
the URL, performs a Fuse search on the json data created by Nikola's
search plugin, and returns a list of top 5 results.  It just took me
about an hour to write, but is pretty useful, I think.

At my <a href="http://enthought.com">$dayjob</a>, for the most part of October, I had the fortune of
pair programming with <a href="https://plus.google.com/114995175796183910458/posts">Martin</a> and it was an amazing learning
experience!  To share these lessons with my colleagues, I made a small
presentation at lunch, to my colleagues.  <a href="https://rawgithub.com/punchagan/340e1350fdfc766c6599/raw/ca1f5fe9bfc1cc503cd8a524e350bd29e8f5f33d/month-with-martin.html">Here are the slides</a> for the
presentation.
