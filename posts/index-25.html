<p>
Also, thanks for the two patches she sent.

<li>Feature addition - Posting sub-trees instead of whole buffers.
I had this feature in mind, and had started working on it after
her request, but she was too quick for me! ;)

No.  Not the Obama change.  I'm talking of change as in small
denominations of cash.  Everybody is reluctant to part with
it.  There's always a problem with getting it.  I'm often worried
before getting into a bus or an auto, or going to a shop whether
or not the guy would give me change for a 50, 100 or a 500.
People so reluctant to "part" with it. What are they saving it
for?
</p>

<p>
I think the situation would be much better if people readily gave
it, when required.  There would be a free flow and if not anything
more, I wouldn't have to worry about it when going somewhere.
But, I "feel" this would actually reduce the instances when both
the parties don't have enough change with them. What do you think?

I've often got bad service from "service providers" - hotels,
restaurants, phone services, Internet services etc. I guess that's
due to the population in India. If one customer goes back unhappy
that doesn't really make a difference, because there would be
hundred others already waiting in the queue.
</p>

<p>
You, as a, service provider would get your share of customers and
profits, no matter how bad you are. Thanks to the population.
</p>

<p>
One solution could be, to write about the bad service you got from
a provider and make people aware of it, but often there aren't
enough options, for others to choose from. Inevitably, the bad
service provider is going to get some customers. What's the way
out?

 For the uninitiated, vimperator is an emacs plugin to get Firefox
working with vim keybindings and firemacs <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/vimperator-and-firemacs.html#fn.1">1</a></sup> is for emacs keybindings.
</p>

<p>
I'm obsessed with emacs (as should already be evident) and can't
really edit text without it's key-bindings. There are others like me,
and hence the firemacs plugin. It's a blessing for my tribe.
</p>

<p>
Firemacs is great, except for the one great feature that it lacks -
being able to jump to links/textareas without using the mouse.  I've
seen Nishanth do it with ease, using Vimperator. I wanted to add this
feature to Firemacs, by copying some code from Vimperator to
Firemacs.  I directly started looking at the code, but couldn't make
head or tail of it. I got a few doubts about how Vimperator works,
since I'd never used it. Nishanth asked me to simply install it and
try it out.
</p>

<p>
And then we had our EUREKA! moment. Vimperator and Emacs both
enabled together work seamlessly well. Two obsessed people are happy
and satisfied! And hopefully many more. :D

After a trek, I had an interesting conversation with Ritesh, about
taking pictures during a trip. He said, he started to realize that
when he's lost in the cycle of click, see, analyze, click,
… when he's got a cam in his hand. He didn't have a cam on this
trek and thoroughly enjoyed it!
</p>

<p>
I connect to this phenomenon, as well. I think, like Ritesh says,
having separate trips for Photography makes sense. On other trips,
we could be clicking, but just for the sake of memory. Trying to
get amazing photographs shouldn't be a goal.
I should refrain from -
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>looking at the output and adjusting repeatedly until it's
perfect.
</li>
<li>clicking too many pictures in a given length of time.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For both of this, a film camera seems to be the solution!
</p>

<p>
What say, Ritesh?

Sage Days is a confluence of present and prospective SAGE Users and
Developers. It is an opportunity to come together to share ideas,
brainstorm and hack on Sage. Sage Days 25 is the 25th version of Sage
Days, and is being organized in Mumbai, India. In order to cater to an
Indian audience and scenario, this version has been tweaked
slightly. Sage Days 25 has beginner level tutorials, in addition to
the usual talks and sprints, to help new users get started with Sage
and help promote the use of Sage in India.

<h2 id="sec-2">What is Sage?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Sage is a free, open-source mathematics software system licensed under
the GPL. It combines the power of numerous existing open-source
packages into a common Python-based interface. It's mission is to
create a "viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple,
Mathematica and Matlab". Sage has tools for a broad range of
mathematical areas like Linear Algebra, Calculus, Symbolic Math,
Plotting, Rings &amp; Groups, Graph Theory, Number Theory and
Cryptography. Essentially, "it can do anything from mapping a
12-dimensional object to calculating rainfall patterns under global
warming" - as Science Daily puts it . Eager to get started? Start
here. Apart from being feature rich, it's usability is one of it's
greatest strengths. Sage Notebook, a web-interface for all the math
you'll ever want to do, is really the killer feature! As the Sage
Marketing page says, "The SAGE GUI surely works on your computer box,
because it just runs in Firefox!". Try it Now!

Sage Days 25 is being attended by the creator and lead developer of
Sage, Prof. William Stein. It will also be attended by other
developers of Sage. This would be a great opportunity to meet and
interact with them! The conference will be attended by a plethora of
enthusiastic people from all over the country who use Sage or are
interested in doing so. The conference will also see the presence of
many mathematicians interested in software. Who knows, you may run
into someone you'd want to collaborate with, for your future work!
This event will be a great learning experience, if you are even
remotely interested in math and software for it!

<del>I'd</del> We had been on a 60 km long trip today. My second one, and
Ritesh's first. The map of our route is here. On the whole the ride
was wonderful! A thoroughly enjoyable one. It was near perfect, with
it raining only as much as we enjoyed an not anymore. :)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The ride on Godbander Road was the most enjoyable part of the
ride. Simple Wonderful! That's what made the trip worth it!
</li>

<li>It was more relaxed than my previous ride and it took us about 5
hours on the whole. We must've been pedalling for about 4 hours. I
don't have the "actual" figures.
</li>

<li>Except for the stretch of Western express highway (service road)
from Jogeshwari to a little after the Sanjay Gandhi National park's
entrance, the road was decent. The Eastern Express highway service
road was awesome!
</li>

<li>Cycling alone is totally different from cycling with someone
else. We didn't really go together, but we were meeting up once in a
while. The loneliness, of rides on which you are alone, is
absent. But waiting for, or catching up with the other guy is a bit
tricky. I wonder how it would be with a bigger group.
</li>

<li>I tried to keep going at about 60% effort and I still had quite a
bit of juice left in me, at the end of the ride.
</li>

<li>My cycle is definitely good! I really only understood this after
exchanging my cycle.
</li>

<li>Exchanging cycles felt nice. A slightly different set of muscles
were in action. The newness kinda helped.
</li>

<li>I should probably get myself a bigger round frame spectacles. Or I'm
craning my neck a bit too much, to keep looking ahead, while
pedaling. How about contacts?
</li>

<li>The problem with riding on the left of Highways is that you
"compete" with heavy vehicles. It sometimes gets a bit scary.
</li>

<li>I should get a helmet soon.
</li>

<li>I should get in touch with local cycling groups and tag along with
them on a couple of rides. I'll get to learn a lot of things.
</li>

<li>Ritesh took a few pics with his phone. <del>Photos in some later post or
with an update</del>.
</li>

<li>Where to next? A ride inside the National park, probably or the
wonderful roads of Navi Mumbai.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Kudos Ritesh!
</p>

<p>
<b>UPDATE:</b> A few pictures, that Ritesh clicked on his phone. All the
photos were on the Godbander Road.

After a short break, I'm back to blogging!
A few things have changed meanwhile. A lot haven't.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Noetic Nought shall now be called Rustic Reverie.
</li>

<li>The Blogs I read page is now manually populated. More pages might be
coming soon.
</li>

<li>My web presence has almost been reduced to just this blog. I hope to
be blogging more often this time around. I guess I'll have shorter
and more frequent posts. "Release early, Release often."
</li>

<li>I've been inspired by Sacha Chua and her wonderful blog. She puts up
anything that -
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>she may look up in future.
</li>
<li>could be remotely useful to anybody on this planet.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I like her idea of "thinking of writing as sketching". "Keep
repeating yourself, until the core message floats to the top". It
feels similar to the idea - "Release early, Release often."
</p>
</li>

<li>Also, Thanks to Madhu and Vattam who set an impossibly high standard
by having their resumes and letters of recommendations and other
"personal" stuff on version control on public repositories.
</li>

<li>All my posts will be made from org2blog - a little org-mode based
client that I hacked up. Emacs and Org-mode all the way! This is the
first post by me (and probably anybody) from org2blog!
