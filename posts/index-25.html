In a world of (RSS &amp; Atom) feeds, deleting your posts is not the
way to do it.
</p>

<p>
First re-post using no content and give the post some time for it
to be caught by the feed aggregators. Then, delete your post.

Heavy down-pour and landslides caused our train to be delayed by
over 12 hours. But the journey was on the whole enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
The novelty of the journey was that we had a bus ride from Adavali
to Ratnagiri, arranged by the Indian Railways, owing to bad tracks
near Ratnagiri.  It was very well planned and neatly executed.
Kudos Indian Railways!  The Konkan Rail route was at it's usual
best.

At work, we use hg and to be frank, I haven't really got the
hang of using it well. I've recently started using git for my own
work and I'm loving it.
</p>

<p>
I chose git because
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>github seems to be a nice place to hang around, as compared to
bit-bucket.
</li>
<li>org-mode uses git and I need to learn to use git, if I intend
</li>
</ul>
<p>
contribute anything to org-mode.
</p>

<p>
But after using git for a month or so, I'm totally loving using
git. The way it handles merges is awesome. People go gaga over
it's speed.
</p>

<p>
But for me, it's the way it handles branches. I can have any
number of branches on my machine, while pushing only changes in
the master branch, upstream. I can easily merge changes from one
branch to another. After putting up a lot of fight, I couldn't
make hg do this. Not as well as git does it!
</p>

<p>
I've now decided to convert my personal repositories to git.
</p>

<p>
This blog post shows how to.

No.  Not the Obama change.  I'm talking of change as in small
denominations of cash.  Everybody is reluctant to part with
it.  There's always a problem with getting it.  I'm often worried
before getting into a bus or an auto, or going to a shop whether
or not the guy would give me change for a 50, 100 or a 500.
People so reluctant to "part" with it. What are they saving it
for?
</p>

<p>
I think the situation would be much better if people readily gave
it, when required.  There would be a free flow and if not anything
more, I wouldn't have to worry about it when going somewhere.
But, I "feel" this would actually reduce the instances when both
the parties don't have enough change with them. What do you think?

I've often got bad service from "service providers" - hotels,
restaurants, phone services, Internet services etc. I guess that's
due to the population in India. If one customer goes back unhappy
that doesn't really make a difference, because there would be
hundred others already waiting in the queue.
</p>

<p>
You, as a, service provider would get your share of customers and
profits, no matter how bad you are. Thanks to the population.
</p>

<p>
One solution could be, to write about the bad service you got from
a provider and make people aware of it, but often there aren't
enough options, for others to choose from. Inevitably, the bad
service provider is going to get some customers. What's the way
out?

 For the uninitiated, vimperator is an emacs plugin to get Firefox
working with vim keybindings and firemacs <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/vimperator-and-firemacs.html#fn.1">1</a></sup> is for emacs keybindings.
</p>

<p>
I'm obsessed with emacs (as should already be evident) and can't
really edit text without it's key-bindings. There are others like me,
and hence the firemacs plugin. It's a blessing for my tribe.
</p>

<p>
Firemacs is great, except for the one great feature that it lacks -
being able to jump to links/textareas without using the mouse.  I've
seen Nishanth do it with ease, using Vimperator. I wanted to add this
feature to Firemacs, by copying some code from Vimperator to
Firemacs.  I directly started looking at the code, but couldn't make
head or tail of it. I got a few doubts about how Vimperator works,
since I'd never used it. Nishanth asked me to simply install it and
try it out.
</p>

<p>
And then we had our EUREKA! moment. Vimperator and Emacs both
enabled together work seamlessly well. Two obsessed people are happy
and satisfied! And hopefully many more. :D

After a trek, I had an interesting conversation with Ritesh, about
taking pictures during a trip. He said, he started to realize that
when he's lost in the cycle of click, see, analyze, click,
… when he's got a cam in his hand. He didn't have a cam on this
trek and thoroughly enjoyed it!
</p>

<p>
I connect to this phenomenon, as well. I think, like Ritesh says,
having separate trips for Photography makes sense. On other trips,
we could be clicking, but just for the sake of memory. Trying to
get amazing photographs shouldn't be a goal.
I should refrain from -
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>looking at the output and adjusting repeatedly until it's
perfect.
</li>
<li>clicking too many pictures in a given length of time.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
For both of this, a film camera seems to be the solution!
</p>

<p>
What say, Ritesh?
