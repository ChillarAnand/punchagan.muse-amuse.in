I had a strict character limit of 180 chars for something I was
writing. I just wrote a simple function to count characters in a
region or a buffer. Another function to count the words.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun count-chars ()
    "Count the number of chars in a buffer or region."
    (interactive)
    (let* ((beg (if (region-active-p) (region-beginning) (point-min)))
           (end (if (region-active-p) (region-end) (point-max))))
           (message (number-to-string (- end beg)))))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun count-words ()
    "Count the number of words in a buffer or region."
    (interactive)
    (let* ((beg (if (region-active-p) (region-beginning) (point-min)))
           (end (if (region-active-p) (region-end) (point-max)))
           (count 0))
      (save-excursion
        (goto-char beg)
        (while (< (point) end)
          (forward-word)
          (setq count (1+ count))))
      (message (int-to-string count))))
#+end_src
