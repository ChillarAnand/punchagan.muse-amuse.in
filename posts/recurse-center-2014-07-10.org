- I was just refactoring bits of the code, and clubbed all the different
  visitors into a single visitor to speed up the code.
- We also had a birthday celebration of one of the facilitators.
- I also gave my first presentation at Hacker School.  I thought it was cool.
  Not sure if everyone thought it was.
