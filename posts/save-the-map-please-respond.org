The Ministry of Home Affairs put out a [[http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/GeospatialBill_05052016_eve.pdf][draft]] and an RFC for a Geo-spatial bill

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To regulate the acquisition, dissemination, publication and distribution of
geospatial information of India which is likely to affect the security,
sovereignty and integrity of India.
#+END_QUOTE

Even if you put aside questions about how a vetting process, for "dealing with"
any geospatial information, would help with the said goals, the bill defines
/geospatial information/ so broadly that even taking a geo-tagged picture at
the Taj mahal or sharing the location of your house for a meal delivery would
have you breaking the law.

A group of volunteers made [[http://savethemap.in][Save the map]] which has more information on this,
along with a draft response that you can send to the Ministry.  Please respond
before June 2nd, 2016.
