I have been trying to get ERC working with notifications. Julien Danjou's
wonderful <a href="https://julien.danjou.info/blog/2012/erc-notifications">notifications</a> module for ERC is great, but it is annoying to get
notifications even when Emacs is in focus.
</p>

<p>
I had looked at <a href="https://github.com/eqyiel/circe-notifications/blob/master/circe-notifications.el">circe-notifications</a>, which has the feature but uses xdotool and
xprop to do it.  I was looking for something simpler, though… and it suddenly
struck me that I have an auto-save hook in Emacs that is run when I focus out
of it.  I wondered if I could disable and enable notifications on focus, and it
worked.
</p>

<p>
In case it is useful for somebody else -

<p>
I wonder if there are some corner cases where this doesn't work, and that's why
the author of circe-notifications chose the tools that he did.

I've been trying to use <code>org-drill</code> regularly for the last few weeks.  I don't
know how well it's been going but I have been sticking to the routine
religiously.  I haven't yet really tried out incremental reading, but in an
attempt to make it as easy as possible, I wanted to have a pdf-reader
integration, and some kind of integration with Kindle highlights.  Browser
integration is pretty straight-forward, thanks to some <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#sec-6">simple java-script</a>.
</p>

<p>
I looked for a pdf-reader with some sort of plugin support, but I found nothing
in Evince or Okular.  I thought about <code>pdfjs</code> but it seemed slightly clunky to
open pdfs in a browser, though I might shift to this if I don't like what I
finally ended up with.  Good old <code>xpdf</code> seemed to be the only pdf reader that
had some support for custom keybindings that allowed users to run external
commands.  With a <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/xpdf-capture">little Python</a>, I was able to setup a work-flow to capture
snippets from <code>xpdf</code>, to add to org-drill. Custom key-bindings somehow don't
seem to work on <code>xpdf</code> bundled on Ubuntu. So, I ended up downloading and using
the binary available on the xpdf site.
</p>

<p>
For Kindle highlights support, with minor updates to Thamer Mahmoud's <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/clip2org">clip2org</a>,
I have a simple way of getting all the "new" clippings/highlights as org-drill
headlines.  I haven't really started using this, and once I do, I may end-up
automating even the merging of these items into the org-drill notes file.  I'm
looking forward to making better use of my Kindle, with this feature!
</p>

<p>
I don't know if it would be useful to have more context information like
section titles/chapter titles when capturing from html/pdf, but it seems like
an interesting problem to try to solve.
</p>

<p>
Also, it might be easier(?) if I probably tried to have a DE level keybinding, and
some code to get selection and file name of the currently active
window/application.

I stumbled on a <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/178-rr-book-club-refactoring-ruby-with-martin-fowler/">Ruby Rogues podcast</a> yesterday, which had <a href="http://martinfowlwer.com">Martin Fowler</a> as the
guest.  I really enjoyed the discussion on Refactoring (the noun, the verb and
the book!)
</p>

<p>
Martin clarified in the podcast that refactoring (the verb/process) is a
sequence of very small refactorings, while you keep making sure that you can
run the test suite always.  A refactoring (noun) is a change where you change
the structure of the code without any externally observable changes, with the
intent of making it easier to understand and cheaper to change in future.
</p>

<p>
I also really liked the metaphor of a 'healthy code base'.  Refactoring is,
then, the process of keeping healthy – exercise, speaking metaphorically.  You
can stack up all the exercise you need to do, until you get really unfit.
Refactoring, similarly, needs to be done regularly, to keep the code base
healthy.  This lets you go faster, in the future.
</p>

<p>
I also really liked the advise about trying to push back the mental contexts
you build, while trying to debug/understand some code that is not very clear,
by refactoring the code to make it clearer.  Code needn't be one big chunk of
cryptographic text.  Code is writing.  It should be clear and understandable.
Or, at least we should strive to make it so!
</p>

<p>
The discussion, as always on this podcast, was very lively, pleasant and
enjoyable! Enjoy!

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>

    <p>
I have been reading a bunch of articles on the SuperMemo site (including the
<a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol.htm">original thesis</a> of P. A. Wozniack, the creator of SuperMemo).  I initially
started off trying to understand the algorithms SM2,5 and 8 which org-drill
implements, but reading the articles has given me a lot of general background
and theory on how memory works, and why SuperMemo is as effective as it is (for
those who stick with it).  This blog post is an attempt to summarize and
capture what I have read in all those <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/contents.htm">articles</a>, and not get lost in them.  I
would recommend reading the thesis and the suggested reading there, yourself,
but if you really don't want to – this blog post + the summary in <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm#Prioritize">here</a>, and
<a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/decalog.htm#decalog">here</a> would be a good alternative.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Memory works by repetition.  Each time you recall a fact, the time it takes
for the memory to fade increases.  Spaced repetition is the idea of repeating
items, just when you are about to forget them – trying to optimize the time
spent on learning, as well as the retention of learned material.
</li>

<li>Prioritization of the items we need to learn is key to being able to stick to
Spaced repetition.  Beginners tend to be over-enthusiastic about the
technique and fill up their system with stuff that they don't really care
about.  Applicability of the knowledge you are trying to gain, is a good test
for whether or not it goes into your system.
</li>

<li>Each version of SuperMemo comes with a slightly modified (on most occassions,
improved!) algorithm.  SM2, SM5, … refer to these algorithms. Org-drill
currently supports only sm2,5 and 8.  It may be worth looking at sm15/16 and
seeing if it can be implemented and is worth doing.  In any case, using any
of these is <b>way</b> better than not using Spaced repetition at all.
</li>

<li>Understanding what we are trying to learn goes a long way in helping
memory. It is, therefore, good to start with basic material. People have been
surprised by how easily the advanced stuff fell into place, once they had the
basics covered.
</li>

<li>Keep items in the system simple.  Stick to the minimum information
principle.  Keeping it simple, doesn't mean you leave out on learning the
complex stuff; instead break it into simpler components.  Simpler items has
the following advantages:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Simple is easier to remember.
</li>
<li>Simpler items are easier to schedule.  You get more resolution to figure
out what the problem areas are.
</li>
<li>Simple makes brings in redundancy automatically.  And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redundancy_is_good">redundancy is good</a>
for memory, just like it is for managing hardware failure.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Keep learning fun!  Don't make review sessions a chore.  Think about the
material you are reviewing. Edit/delete/improve items based on your reviews,
then and there. Stay active.
</li>

<li>It is useful to add a link to the source of the items added to your system,
considering that you wish to use the system over a long period of time
(ideally, the rest of your life!)
</li>

<li>Prioritize, add examples, appeal to your emotional state, link to existing
knowledge, use images. Anything else that works for you!  Use all of these
techniques, that work well and you probably already use in everyday life, in
the items you add to your system, to make them easier to recall.
</li>

<li>Being physically fit and healthy is important for being so
mentally. Exercise, sleep, eat well, avoid caffeine.
</li>

<li>Try <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm">incremental</a> <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/devour.htm">reading</a>, as an input source of items into your memory system.

I have been trying to get back to using org-mode and its clocking
functionality, more often than not.  I used to use it a lot, a few years ago,
and haven't been using it, since I had been in my last job.
</p>

<p>
To help with it, I decided to integrate clocking in and out with changing
status on Pidgin, and turning notifications on and off in Gnome.  Here's a few
lines of code that does this for me.

<a href="http://baali.muse-amuse.in">@baali</a> tried to use my code, and it turns out it didn't work for him, because I
forgot to mention that <code>(ad-activate 'org-clock-in)</code> needs to be run, after the
<code>defadvice</code> code.  I have no idea how it worked for me, without doing that.
May be because I have <code>defadvice</code> for other functions?
</p>

<p>
Also, while debugging this, I found that <code>defadvice</code> is a deprecated way of
doing this, and <code>add-function</code> is the way to go now.  But, instead of advising
the function, I decided to make use of <code>org-clock-in-hook</code>.

myself.  Sprints for bug fixing, adding new features to a project may be a
good way to get new developers to start contributing to FOSS projects.  It
would be even better to be in touch with folks before the event, and use this
opportunity to iron out kinks.

I think the talks could be improved drastically. A lot<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/making-pycon-india-better-for-myself.html#fn.1">1</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="/posts/making-pycon-india-better-for-myself.html#fn.2">2</a></sup> has been said,
already.  Here's a summary of how I see it.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Beginner/Novice talks doesn't mean bad talks.  A talk with a good narrative,
that drives home a point, that may be familiar to most of the audience, would
still make a good talk.  I don't mind reading a good blog post/book on a
topic I already know, because there is joy in reading/listening to "good"
stuff.
</li>

<li>Talks cannot be judged by titles or an abstract.  Taking inspiration from
PyCon US, we could

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ask for a video recording of a previous talk or a short home-made
recording of the speaker presenting some topic.
</li>

<li>Ask for a granular outline <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/making-pycon-india-better-for-myself.html#fn.3">3</a></sup> along with rough timing information, instead of
just an abstract.
</li>

<li>Have a bunch of resources <sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="/posts/making-pycon-india-better-for-myself.html#fn.4">4</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="/posts/making-pycon-india-better-for-myself.html#fn.5">5</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="/posts/making-pycon-india-better-for-myself.html#fn.6">6</a></sup> available for speakers to improve on their
proposals/accepted talks.
</li>

<li>Have a bunch of 20 or 30 minute talks, and very few longer (45 min) talk
slots.
</li>

<li>Encourage speakers to try connecting their laptops and iron out
"presentation" kinks on the day before their talks/lunch/other allotted
times. Technical issues like fonts being too small, mics not working,
adjusting the volume/other settings for the speaker, etc. can and should be
fixed before hand.
</li>

<li>The talk review committee could also take notes from attending some of the
talks, and compare it against their notes when they accepted the talk, to
improve the talk selection process.  Some of it could be valuable feedback
for the speakers too.

Org-drill is an Org-mode extension that provides spaced-repetition and
flash-card functionality.  It has a <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html">wonderful documentation on Worg</a>, but
somehow I couldn't get myself to read the whole document, and setup org-drill,
until now.
</p>

<p>
The setup is quite straight forward, once you have org-mode along with the
<code>contrib</code> packages.  Just <code>(require 'org-drill)</code>, and you are all set!  To add
a new card, all you need to do is add a <code>:drill:</code> tag to the items you wish to
"Org-drill".  You can start a review session with simply <code>M-x org-drill</code>.  You
will be shown flash cards, and you can rate how correct and comfortable you
were, in answering the questions.  Based on your responses, the cards are
scheduled for review.  Start another review session, whenever you need one!
</p>

<p>
What I could only understand once I got myself to read the whole document was
that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The default scope of a drill session is the current file.  But, you can start
sessions with scopes like current tree, current directory, or a specified
list of files. This is super-useful!
</li>

<li>The review sessions are not automatically scheduled, based on when you
schedule failed flash-cards.  Scheduling the review for a card only sets a
due-date for them, and effects, what you are asked in your next session.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Cram mode and incremental reading are also things I want to try, as I go along.
</p>

<p>
Happy Learning!

<p>
I was trying to pair on writing a simple app that uses Hacker
School's OAuth2 API, and hit a roadblock on the first step of
requesting an authorization from the user.  Once the user authorized
my app, I would see an error that said, "The authorization server
does not support this response type".  I was using a client library
that I had <a href="https://github.com/litl/rauth">used before</a>, and the server was using a what seemed like
a <a href="https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper">popular implementation</a> for ruby on rails.  Getting weird errors is
not done!
</p>

<p>
I have used OAuth2 based authentication <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/statiki/blob/master/statiki.py#L49">before</a>, but the thought of
using it always makes me a little nervous, just because
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I don't understand it very well.
</li>
<li>Like almost everything else, there seem to be so many libraries
for doing this in Python, and I'm never sure which one to use, or
which one I used the last time around.  Not understanding the
protocol also doesn't let me debug anything that comes up.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To fix this, I set about to read and understand the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth2 protocol</a>.
This blog post is an attempt to record it for future reference, and
possibly act as a reference for others.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Why OAuth</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
OAuth is simply a way for an end-user to allow third parties to use
protected data, without sharing the user's credentials with the
third-party.
</p>

<p>
For example, an end-user (Jane) can grant a printing service
(Printo) access to her protected photos stored at a photo-sharing
service (Picasa), without sharing her username and password with the
printing service.  Instead, she authenticates directly with a server
trusted by the photo-sharing service, which issues the printing
service delegation-specific credentials. (example from the OAuth 2.0
spec)
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Protocol Flow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<img src="/images/536281e1af42c5729864722aa6e9019ef9e93c0a.png">


<p>
The flow occurs through a sequence of user actions, client requests
and user-agent (browser) redirects.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(A) Printo asks Jane to allow using Picasa Data. The request can
be sent directly to Jane, but is usually routed via
Picasa/Google.
</li>

<li>(B) Printo gets back an authorization grant, which is a
credential representing Jane's authorization or approval.  The
type of the actual grant credential depends on the type of
request that Printo used.
</li>

<li>(C, D) Printo gets back to Google with the credentials it obtained
in the previous step and obtains a token that it can use to talk
with Picasa.
</li>

<li>(E, F) Printo asks for the desired photo with the token it
obtained previously, and Picasa gives back the photo to print.
Jane gets her framed photo!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
But before any of this happens, the client needs to register with
the authorization server and obtain a <code>client_id</code> and
<code>client_secret</code>, that will be used to identify the client making
the requests.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Pythonized "authorization code" work-flow.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The OAuth2 spec allows the authorization request/grant to be of 4
different types.  It also allows some flexibility in the token
type.
</p>

<p>
In my experience, the most common work-flow seems to be using an
<i>authorization code</i> as an authorization grant, and using a <i>Bearer</i>
type token.  This work-flow is explained in the diagram below (taken
from the spec document).  This diagram zooms in, onto the steps A-D
in the diagram above.

<p>
This <a href="https://gist.github.com/punchagan/76e8771fc26cd243f3ac">python code snippet</a> is a simple implementation of this
workflow, using the Hacker School API.

<h2 id="sec-5">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
I think, I understand the OAuth2 spec a lot better now, and hope
that this will help others understand it, too.  And more
importantly, I won't get nervous when I have to add it to my
projects.
</p>

<p>
Also, <a href="https://github.com/idan/oauthlib">oauthlib</a> for Python seems to be a pretty thorough
implementation of the spec, and <a href="https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib">requests-oauthlib</a> seems to wrap it
for use with requests.  I think I'm going to use this in my future
projects.

I don't have much of a work-flow, because I don't post too often, but
here is what I typically do, to make a new post.

I start off by creating a new post using

I have a simple snippet that lets me insert tags, based on existing
tags.

Once I'm happy with the content of a post, I run <code>nikola auto</code> to
build the source and serve it locally, and see if the post "looks"
reasonable, after being rendered.

Once, I'm happy with it, I commit the post and deploy it using <code>nikola
deploy</code>.

At home, my video would always show a silhouette in G+ and Skype, and
I always thought that this was because the lighting at home was not
sufficient.  At office, the video was decent.  But, moving to sit
right under the light also didn't help much.
</p>

<p>
Struggling with a bunch of tools like <code>v4lctl</code>, <code>guvcview</code> didn't
help. But, during these struggles I noticed that <code>cheese</code> would show
me bright and cheerful, while all the other programs showed my
silhouette.
</p>

<p>
I set out to "fake" the output of <code>cheese</code> as a video device that
skype and other programs could use. But, I didn't have to go all the
way.  I ended up using <a href="https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback/">v4l2loopback</a> to create a loopback video device,
and just using <code>gst-launch</code> to redirect video to that device, did the
trick!  Thanks gstreamer!  Thanks v4l2loopback! :)
