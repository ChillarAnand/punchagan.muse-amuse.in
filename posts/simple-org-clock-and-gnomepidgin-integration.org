I have been trying to get back to using org-mode and its clocking
functionality, more often than not.  I used to use it a lot, a few years ago,
and haven't been using it, since I had been in my last job.

To help with it, I decided to integrate clocking in and out with changing
status on Pidgin, and turning notifications on and off in Gnome.  Here's a few
lines of code that does this for me.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(defadvice org-clock-in (after pc/org-clock-in (&optional select start-time))
  "Turn gnome notifications off."
  (dbus-send-signal
   :session
   "org.gnome.SessionManager"
   "/org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence"
   "org.gnome.SessionManager.Presence"
   "SetStatus" 2)
  (shell-command "purple-remote setstatus?status=unavailable"))

(defadvice org-clock-out (after pc/org-clock-out (&optional switch-to-state fail-quietly at-time))
  "Turn gnome notifications back on."
  (dbus-send-signal
   :session
   "org.gnome.SessionManager"
   "/org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence"
   "org.gnome.SessionManager.Presence"
   "SetStatus" 0)
  (shell-command "purple-remote setstatus?status=available"))
