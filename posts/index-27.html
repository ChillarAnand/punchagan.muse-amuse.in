My first Cricket match in a stadium. I regret that it was a
T-20. I'm happy, though, to have got the darshan of bhaiyya a.k.a
Sachin. Also, I did enjoy the energy of being in a stadium.
</p>

<p>
I was actually intent on watching MI vs. RR, but, junta voted in
favor of the Opening Ceremony. It was a grandiloquent let-down,
but for the fireworks. There was nothing really spectacular about
the ceremony. A mediocre performance… With the kind of money
they have at hand, and have spent, I really would've liked
something better.
</p>

<p>
The match. DC vs. KKR. DC lost a game that it could've comfortably
won. It would've been a decent match to watch, if not for the
stupid DJ-ing. The game looked so different from what I'm used to
seeing on the TV. [The only thing that was exactly as I saw in TV
was, the crowd drooling at the cheer girls.]
</p>

<p>
I was shocked by the amount of disturbance a player has to
overcome, while playing. Has the "gentle-man's" game turned into a
"super-man's" game? Between each and every ball, the DJ is either
shouting some incomprehensible inanities or playing some crazy
"number" at the highest volume. The batsmen almost had to wait for
him to shut up, before each ball. Can someone tell me if these are
perks that the third version brings with it, or if I was happily
ignorant, thanks to the TV watching? The heart-beat sound in the
final overs was ridiculously annoying. I was looking forward to
one of the batsmen throwing his bat at the DJ.
</p>

<p>
Also, it's a big joke to call this ground a "home" for DC. It was
nothing close to a home ground, in terms of the crowd. I don't see
Cuttack being any more homely, especially with the Kalinga Sena
already passing crazy orders to the cricketers. DC will have to
play exceedingly well to end-up anywhere near the top.  But,
amidst all this, I'm happy for the people of AP. With a huge
electric-power crisis looming ahead, they have already saved (or
produced) power worth 7 IPL matches!
</p>

<p>
Also, this is the end of IPL v3 for me. I'm done with cricket for
this season.
</p>

announces.

This post is my attempt to start a travelogue. I hope to capture
the "All India Tour" phase of my life (as people have started to
call it).  I'll try to keep these posts from becoming travel
guides. There are loads of them and I surely don't need to
increment count.
</p>

<p>
This post is after a trip to Kanpur, Agra and Sikri.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Trains are never on Time. The delay increases exponentially with
your distance from the sourthern most tip of the country. Also,
the confidence of the aam admi in this delay is proportional to
the distance. Any delay less than an hour wasn't considered to
be a delay. Thanks to the fog, low visibility.
</li>
<li>If you want to travel around India, all you need is an
SLR. Additionally, if you are not of Indian origin, you'll need
the "India" guide. I got bored of seeing people poring over the
pages of that "blue" India book or madly clicking away on their
SLRs.
</li>
<li>Whether or not you get food or water on a train, you are assured
of enough "chilled" air from the slit under your window. Come
what may, you shall not be deprived of this service.
</li>
<li>The trust of a person in you is inversely proportional to the
difference between your ages. It is inversely proportional to
the 2.718th power of the difference if you are aged between 20
and 25. I only vaguely remember what the TTE told me in my
sleep, while paying the fine for not carrying a print out of our
e-ticket; but, it really was something sick and senseless.
</li>
<li>The chill at a place, on the day you reach, is inversely
proportional to how much people have scared/warned you. On the
rest of the days, it is proportional to the square of the warm
clothing you have on you. I thoroughly enjoyed the chill of
Kanpur. Wonderful! The infrastructure, too good! Never expected
a 50 year old campus to be so Awesome. [They have an air-strip
too!]
</li>
<li>The thrill of having an ice-cream is proportional to the square
of difference between the ambient temperature and the standard
room temperature.
</li>
<li>Don't ever think of celebrating your escape, without the Aalu
encounter. Welcome to the land of Alu addicted men. You shall,
surely, have your share. If not anything else, you shall be
serverd a Capsicum or Brinjal stuffed with Aalu. Also, the
quality and availability of leather seems to be proportional to
the addiction to Aalu.
</li>
<li>"hawker time" - the time you spend being followed by hawkers
trying to convince you to buy whatever they
have. "firang-ness" - difficult to predict; a parameter that
depends on the amount of branded stuff on you, stylishness of
your winter wear and other unknown variableness. Your hawker
time is proportional to (firang-ness) \\* abs(time of day in 24
hr clock - 1400) [when, 900 &lt; time &lt; 1800] I understand, that,
they need to make ends meet; each day of their lives. I got
followed a lot. I can't help observing. Sometimes, enjoyed being
followed too.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Taj. Simply Awe-Inspiring. As Madhu put it, "the longer you
keep watching it, the more it's beauty overwhelms you". But, I
still think, the first time is the best time to see it. It's
simply mind blowing when you get the first glimpse, after entering
from the West gate.
</p>

<p>
It's time to stop writing when all you can see is proportionality
between totally unrelated things.  Here are a few pics

Shantanu and I conducted a workshop on Scipy at GNUnify '10. It
was intended to be an introduction to Scipy and Numpy through
Image processing. We expected an audience which was python
literate. But GNUnify's schedule wasn't too favorable for us. Ours
was the first talk scheduled and we ended up getting people who
only "heard" of Python, the language.
</p>

<p>
We had planned quite a bit of stuff expecting a python literate
audience. But unfortunately, we had to start almost from scratch
and couldn't do all of what we planned. Still, the workshop wasn't
too bad. Nobody left mid-way during the 2 hour workshop; nobody
was dozing either.  I would have liked my first talk at a FOSS
event to be better, though.

Like most bloggers, I keep looking at my blogs hits once in a
while. (Sometimes inspires to write better; and more often.) The
post that gets most hits these days is my post on mailman,
postfix, et al. But the search term that's increasingly bringing
people to my blog is "punchagan".
</p>

<p>
This scares me. What makes people search for me? What makes people
search more often these days? Why am I scared?
</p>

<p>
Why do people use monikers or online identities? I started off
with the idea of anonymity and privacy; keeping my online identify
separate from my real one. But it, obviously, is a folly to have
you email id with the same handle. Now, almost anybody who knows
me, also knows my online handle. They can find me anywhere and
everywhere with just a few keystrokes (and Google). Also, the
uniqueness of my handle doesn't help one bit. Any search returns
over 90% relevant results.
</p>

<p>
Is it time to get lost in the crowd with a new handle? ;) Probably
not. I don't have much to hide under the covers. Let the world see
– who I am, who I have been; where I am, where I have been.

<p>
Peace.

I'm now officially a part of the Arch Linux community! Arch Linux
is a lightweight and flexible Linux® distribution that tries to
Keep It Simple.
</p>

<p>
I have started using arch from less than a week or so. It took me
a while, not too long, to realize the beauty of this distro. I was
trying to tweak the settings of my org-mode's remember (on
Karmic), trying to make it work the way I liked it. After breaking
my head with .emacs and lisp for a while, I realized the version
of my org-mode was way different from the version of the docs, I
was reading. It didn't take long to figure out, which version of
org-mode to get. As a matter of curiosity, I checked AUR for the
version, and true to Arch's reputation it was bleeding edge! I was
still using Karmic, since I hadn't got my Arch installation
working the way I like it, yet. Out of laziness. sudo reboot; to
hell with laziness!
</p>

<p>
I was setting up things I regularly use, tweaking my way
around. After a day or so, I find python-numpy is out of date. And
to top it, an orphaned package! I didn't feel one bit good about
this. After some futile attempts to suppress my discomfort, I sat
down to work.
</p>

<p>
After an afternoon of effort, I created my first PKGBUILD. :) I
now have python-numpy installed using pacman! Pleasure to join the
Arch User Community! Also, thanks to lifeeth and Lynus Vaz, for
the sparks.
</p>

<p>
PS: I'm using Arch with Openbox. It's neat! PPS: org-mode is
really awesome! It's a world in itself. life in plain text,

I loved this Google doodle and immediately felt the urge to wish
all of you (using it). I haven't been at home for Sankranti (read

much of a kite-flyer, but I did have my share of moments! Hope you

I've been caught "shooting" with a camera and looked upon as
'terrorist' material. Not once or twice, but 4 times, at 3
different places, by different people. Friends with "pro" cameras
(or pro-looking ones) have been stopped on quite a few occasions
being mistaken for reporters. I'm not talking of those
instances. I am counting the times when I've been in "real"
trouble and was treated as a potential terrorist. Four Times.
</p>

<p>
The last time was special, since I was robbed of cash by a Public
servant in the 'Khakhi', who was apparently doing his duties! I
leave the cribbing about corrupt men and lost cash for later. It
obviously didn't feel nice, being treated in that fashion.
</p>

<p>
And that, just for having a camera and trying to learn the art of
"shooting" pictures. Thankfully, it was something that I could,
shut off (along with my mouth) and throw into my backpack.

What of people born to parents who believe in a particular

Don't tell me I didn't warn you, if you walk into our lab sometime
and mistake it for a game zone in your neighbourhood. You are
indeed in "the" lab. If you came looking for Prof. Prabhu you'll
have to return. You'll only find PR vowing to see the end of
baali, for having a nice time pawning him. You won't find me
around - I'm cloaked and busy creating havoc. Unless, of course,
you are the seer KD. Watch your step extremely carefully or you
won't know when and how fuchmed's GM hit you. And don't dare
venture anywhere near madrazr, jumping all around with a
shockwave, unless you are capable enjoying some real nasty
shocks. Well, the team is busy in one of it's two SB sessions per
day. SB (short for Stress Buster) sessions are intense 15 minute
rounds of bzflag - 3D first person tank battle game.
</p>

<p>
Hope you didn't start thinking, I'm just goofing off here, doing
nothing at all. If it's not already clear, SB sessions are exactly
what they are called - Stress Busters. Just to refresh ourselves
and get back to work, with greater force. What then, am I doing
for the rest of my time?
</p>

<p>
Mainly I've been developing course content that we have been
working on, called Software Tools, Techniques and Practices. I
have been working on a session for elementary LaTeX and basic
Linux tools. I've also been attending classes of Digital Control
and trying to Python-ize the Matlab/Scilab code that the course
uses.
</p>

<p>
But, that's not all. I've helped a guy restore a Joomla site on
Day-1. I screwed up a brand new installation of a server with some
real skill; then expect to be screwed but get some encouragement
with the words, "It was a good learning experience for us." Seen a
Debian server upgrade from Etch to Lenny in under 10
minutes. Installed an instance of twiki and struggled to configure
it. Helped a Humanities Scholar with LaTeX. Attended a workshop on
Instruction Design. Restored Qmail on an old Fedora 3
server. Goofed around in gimp, for a CD cover and a T-shirt
design. Chipped in with bits, for mutating Ubuntu into
"LivePython". Did a bit of css and javascript tweaking… The list
goes on!
</p>

<p>
Now, don't you think we deserve the SB's? ;)

Lost in thought, in the maddening crowd waiting for the next train
on a Sunday evening, I was staring blankly, looking at nothing in
particular. I had come to see-off UC, Sunil and 9.
</p>

<p>
A man carrying a stretcher on his head, suddenly comes into my
focus and I have an impulse to look down. But, I manage to look at
people who are closer to the guy, and see looks of pity, shock and
disgust. Most of them looked down, sooner than later. It was not
long before the man, was right next to me and I could see an
injured man lying on the stretcher with a stream of blood oozing
out of his head. All I could manage was another expression of
pity, shock and disgust. I didn't want to act as if I had seen
nothing. I didn't want to stay as if I could do nothing about
it. I didn't want to look down. But, that's all I ended up
doing. The man carrying the stretcher was not exactly struggling,
but I'm sure he would've more than liked some help. Not one
amongst us moved.
</p>

<p>
Around half a minute later, I see a constable walking calmly
(maybe with a shade of concern in his stride) in that
direction. The next train was there in less than a minute and 9
got into it. I was feeling absolute disgust at my reaction. In the
hope of making some amends, I walked in the direction that the
stretcher guy took. Soon I found them. I didn't have to
search. There was an audience of onlookers, watching the stretcher
carrying guy inspect the other guy. He was waiting near the
entrance of the station and I'm guessing he had called for some
medical help and was waiting for it to arrive. The policeman and a
couple of others were standing next to him, while he was
inspecting the injuries. Everybody else was watching — from the
stairs, from the over bridge, the platform, the
tracks. Everywhere. Being a part of that crowd was the last thing
I wanted to do. I walked away.
</p>

<p>
PS: I (infact, we - uc, sunil, 9 and me) have had my own tryst
with the Mumbai local. Keep your head on your shoulders, while you
are anywhere near them. They are not the trains in your local
fair.

Well, this could be called a post after ages, considering that
most of previous posts have just been 'news reports'. I have been
wanting to make a post since long, but I probably lost it. I
really am unable to write anything that I find worth posting [It
does raise questions about the existence of this blog. I'm writing
this, to answer that question to myself.]
</p>

<p>
This post is provoked by an act of sharing, an act of kindness, an
act of goodness, that surprised me. This post isn't about the act
itself, but it's about me being surprised. Why on earth should I
(or anybody) be surprised, when someone is just being human?
Aren't human beings meant to be and feel human?
</p>

<p>
I wonder why people say, "this is a bad, bad world." I find a lot
of goodness and humanness around me. Unless I strain my memory
really hard, I can only recall people who try to be as good and
nice as they can be; People trying to be as human as
possible. Either there's something utterly wrong with my judgment
of people or there's something wrong with the general feeling that
the world is a bad, bad place.
</p>

<p>
There's one other possibility that just strikes me - I am so nice
to people that, everyone else tries to be nice with me. I don't
think I am such a big deviation from the average. I'm just another
goat, in the great herd.
</p>

<p>
And another one, I'm in a really special place, presently. I have
been only to the special places. I have visited only the places
that are at an extreme, far away from the 'average' place in the
world. But, given I'm just another goat in the great herd, this is
very unlikely. I am probably grazing at a random spot on the great
grasslands.
</p>

<p>
Since these are ruled out, it boils down to either a wrong
judgment or a wrong general feeling.
</p>

<p>
Coming to my judgment, I wouldn't call myself an Oracle or the
wise one, but I'm no dumb ass either. Well, taking the statistical
route, the number of times I've had any real "nasty" surprises in
dealing with people has been much lesser than the number of times
things turned out nearly as expected. My judgment could,
therefore, possibly given some credibility.
</p>

<p>
So, that leaves me with just one possibility. The idea that the
world is a bad, bad place is not entirely true, if not completely
absurd and outright wrong. The world is really a nice place, with
"human" beings inhabiting it. The nasty surprises that you get,
really are the surprises and not the general rule.
