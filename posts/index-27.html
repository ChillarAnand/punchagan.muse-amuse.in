    <p>
Well, there are a hazaar tutorials on setting up Postfix and
Mailman for Debian for a single domain. There were a few for doing
that for multiple domains also, but nothing comprehensive, if I
could say so. This link is pretty comprehensive and details all
the steps for setting up Postfix for a single domain.  Here is all
you'll want to know about setting up Virtual domains in Postfix.
</p>

<p>
You only need to make a few changes for adding a second (or more)
domain. You just need to add the <code>virtual_alias_domains</code> and add
<code>virtual_alias_maps</code>. Here is a glimpse of how my <code>main.cf</code> looks:
</p>

<pre class="example">
myhostname = mail.abc.in
mydomain = abc.in
mydestination = $myhostname, $mydomain, localhost.$mydomain
myorigin = /etc/mailname
virtual_alias_maps =
                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-xyz,
                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-abc,
                hash:/var/lib/mailman/data/virtual-mailman
virtual_alias_domains = xyz.in, mail.xyz.in
</pre>

<p>
<code>virtual-xyz</code> and <code>virtual-abc</code> contain the virtual aliases for
each domain. Note that Postfix expects hash files and hence you
need to run <code>postmap /etc/postfix/virtual-abc</code> each
time the file is changed, to keep the hash file in sync with the
text file that you edit. Also, you need to run <code>postfix reload</code>,
each time you make changes to <code>main.cf</code> or <code>master.cf</code>
</p>

<p>
Fairly straight forward, right? But it took me quite sometime to
get it all right, since this was the first time I was doing
anything with Mail Transfer Agents or the like.
</p>

<p>
Now, onto Mailman. Well the Installation Manual of Mailman,
literally has it all. Here is a look at how my
<code>mm_cfg.py</code> looks:
</p>

<pre class="example">
DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST = 'abc.in'
DEFAULT_URL_HOST   = 'mail.abc.in'
add_virtualhost(DEFAULT_URL_HOST, DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST)
POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS=['xyz.in']
add_virtualhost('mail.xyz.in', 'xyz.in')
MTA='Postfix'
</pre>

<p>
The only trouble was to get mailing lists with same names on both
the domains (which I couldn't get working). I experimented with
multiple mailman instances but that won't work because the MTA
can't differentiate between the two instances of mailman. The
alternative is probably to have two instances of postfix running
too. But that I felt was like going too far, and gave up. [What if
we wanted to add another domain to the list?!]
</p>

<p>
Also, I had to make a few alterations to the Apache file to allow
access to the mailman pages without breaking the Zope redirection
that was already set-up.
</p>

<p>
[Thanks to Shantanu and Vattam (and all the hazaar people using
Postfix and Mailman and cared to document things for the sake of
others, and of course Google)]

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2009</span>
    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>
I had the opportunity to attend a FOSS talk session organized by
Center for Distance Education Engineering Programme (CDEEP) as a
part of the National Mission on Education through ICT. The
National Mission on Education through ICT has some lofty goals,
which when reached will take the country ahead by leaps and
bounds.
</p>

<p>
The Mission has a budget of $1billion in the 11th Five year plan,
40% of which will be spent on content generation (all of which
will be free/open source) and the rest will be spent on making
available a minimum bandwidth of 1Gbps to the 30,000 odd colleges
spread over India (out of which around 3000 are Engineering
colleges). The mission has various projects planned and they are
picking up steam rapidly. The project I will be working on, for
the Adoption of Open Source in Engineering and Science Education
in India, is also a part of this Mission. Prof. Kannan had kick
started the session with an introduction to the National Mission
on Education through ICT. The talks were all being webcast to
various EduSAT centers and on the web.
</p>

<p>
Then, Prof. Pathak talked on, why open source is important. He
said, (not exactly quoting him) " It is theoritically possible for
any person to learn and discover things from scratch, but there's
been only one Ekalavya in the entire history of India." Education
is a social activity and hence open access to content is
absolutely vital. He mentioned various things like how IIT-B has
been working on Creative Commons licensing and other things going
on here. He ended the talk with a hope that soon India will move
from being a net taker of Open source to a net giver to open
source.
</p>

<p>
This was followed by three talks, delivered by developers from
RedHat meant for programmers who wish to contribute to FLOSS.
</p>

<p>
The first talk was by Ramakrishna Reddy, titled 10 things a FLOSS
developer should know. It was a pretty nice and balanced talk,
covering a wide range of things. I would like to point out a few
things, that I liked the most.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He clarified the term hacker as soon as he used it.
</li>
<li>He emphasized a lot on groking code; reading code for fun,
looking at the code of others, reading as much code as
possible…
</li>
<li>He talked of muscle memory of emacsen. I liked the way he talked
of people being so quick with their editors and how learning to
use your tools effectively is a big plus
</li>
<li>Release often, Release early. Everybody talks of it, but he said
a few words, which I liked. Some developers don't usually
release their code as early for the fear of being ridiculed. But
don't bother, "we are just small people, in the whole galaxy."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The next talk was by Prasad Pandit on How to use Infrastructure
for FOSS projects. Prasad talked of Website, Version Control,
Mailing list, IRC, Bugzilla, Wiki and RSS feeds. He gave quite a
few examples on how each thing is important, most of the examples
being his personal experiences.
</p>

<p>
The last talk was by Rahul Sundaram and was on Communication in a
FOSS project. For a change he didn't have slides and the reason
for that, he said, is that communication in a FOSS project is
casual and not having slides and walking in with a t-shirt and
jeans represents that casualness which is a culture of FOSS
projects' communication.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be polite, but don't be Formal.
</li>
<li>Be precise, but do provide a context to what you are saying.
</li>
<li>Don't fear that you'll say something foolish, which, will be
archived for eternity. Mistakes are there to learn from. Not
just you, but others too.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
He talked of quite a lot of things, but these were the things
which struck me as particularly interesting/important.
</p>

<p>
At the end, all the participants walked out with Fedora 11 DVDs
from the RedHat/Fedora guys. :D

<blockquote>
<p>
Our design of this introductory computer-science subject
reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the
idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a
computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel
formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus,
programs must be written for people to read, and only
incidentally for machines to execute. Second, we believe that
the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this
level is not the syntax of particular programming-language
constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular
functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of
algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the
techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of
large software systems.

I would like to see a few courses developed on similar lines here.

<li>Gmail themes are good. I only tried the "Terminal" theme,
though. I loved it!

<b>The Happy Birthday Song</b><br><br>
Once a year we celebrate<br>

And the whole clan gathers round<br>
And gifts and laughter do abound<br>

And sing that stupid song<br><br>

Now you're one year older!<br>
Happy birthday!<br>
Your life still isn't over!<br>

You did not accomplish much<br>
But you didn't die this year<br>
I guess that's good enough<br><br>
So let's drink to your fading health<br>

The chance of finding fame and wealth<br>
Decrease with every year<br><br>
Does it feel like you're doing laps<br>
And eating food and taking naps<br>

<b>Notice for the Internet Usage</b>
</p>

<p>
Internet Facility is provided to students for academic activities
and e-mails. It is observed that few students are misusing the
Internet facility by using excessive internet bandwidth for
non-academic purposes. The students who are running the hubs are
strictly informed to close their hubs. Computer Center will be
starting official hub for the sharing of academic information and
open source softwares.
</p>

<p>
If a student is found while doing so the network facility will be
blocked by Computer Center for a semester. Further, a student will
be called by a disciplinary committee and a severe disciplinary
action will be taken.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This Notice from the Computer Center is creating waves all
around. This isn't the first time, though, that the people
in-charge of the Network have "acted".
</p>

<p>
Academic activities; wonder what it's definition is, in their
dictionaries. It surely includes the following.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using Internet for 'academic activities' or emails, during
class-room hours makes no sense.
</li>
<li>Anything 'academic' cannot have a size greater than 5 MB.
</li>
<li>Accessing version control systems ( svn, cvs et al ) cannot be
classified 'academic'
</li>
<li>IRC cannot teach you anything. Don't ever dream of thinking it
as 'academic' to hang out on \\#python or \\#emacs
</li>
<li>All 'academic' stuff is limited to the http(s) ports. You
wouldn't need to use any other ports, ever.
</li>
<li>Any 'academic' activity fits within a span of 2 hours or can be
done in blocks of 2 hours each, with gaps of 2 hours in between.
</li>
<li>'Academic' stuff doesn't definitely contain key-words chosen by
the "all-knowing" admins.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Moreover, the people in-charge who refused to allow the use of a
computer in the CC as a server for on-campus repositories of
GNU/Linux packages, now wish to host a 'hub' for sharing
open-source softwares! There's already an official ftp server
which hosts the academic info and a few useful softwares. I don't
see how a hub would be different.
</p>

<p>
We don't have any disciplinary committees for people smoking in
hostel rooms, causing a lot of trouble for others around them, but
we are going to have them for hosting hubs. ( Well, a new law
banning smoking in public places in India has been passed just a
few days ago. Hopefully it'll work better than the older one,
since now there's some pressure on the people in-charge of the
public place. )
</p>

<p>
Also, it could be argued that college isn't meant only for
'academic' learning and a lots of other learning takes place here
(and the hubs were definitely helping quite a bit) but I'll leave
that for another day, probably. Also, I don't think 18+ year olds,
people who are about to step into various big roles, leading the
country need to be told how to make use of the
facilities/resources available to them; A degree of freedom is
indispensable, I believe.
</p>

<p>
I appreciate the efforts being made to improve the network
situation here and also help the students get the most (
'academically' ) out of their college experience, but I feel the
situation deserves more careful handling.

Three Cheers to 'Free Software'!
</p>

<p>
A toast for GNU on its 25th Birthday!<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/software-freedom-day.html#fn.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>
If you intend to ask, what I did on this day, I have nothing to show. I haven't done anything that's tangible but yes, I have re-dedicated myself to the idea of Free Software.
This post intends to shed some light on a few things (if not for the benefit of others, just as a reminder for myself)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Free Software is a matter of liberty, not price. I've often been
in a position that required me to correct people. 'Free
Software' is software that's free as in free speech and not free
beer. For the lack of a better word in english, the word 'free'
which also means gratis has been used. Using the term 'Libre'
sometimes helps and if you are in this part of the world, "mukt"
is the best word to use.
</li>
<li>Free Software<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="/posts/software-freedom-day.html#fn.2">2</a></sup> comes along with four fundamental freedoms. To put
it simply, the freedom to use, study, share and modify any
software.
</li>
<li>Free Software may have the advantage of being 'technically
sounder', but the philosophy is what matters the most to me.
</li>
<li>I will do whatever is possible within my capacity to spread the
philosophy and the associated freedom
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Be Free, My Friend!
</p>

<p>
Here is an extract from one of Stallman's <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="/posts/software-freedom-day.html#fn.3">3</a></sup> essays:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We must talk about Freedom
</p>

<p>
Estimates today are that there are ten million users of
GNU/Linux systems such as Debian GNU/Linux and Red Hat
Linux. Free software has developed such practical advantages
that users are flocking to it for purely practical reasons.
</p>

<p>
The good consequences of this are evident: more interest in
developing free software, more customers for free software
businesses, and more ability to encourage companies to develop
commercial free software instead of proprietary software
products.
</p>

<p>
But interest in the software is growing faster than awareness
of the philosophy it is based on, and this leads to
trouble. Our ability to meet the challenges and threats
described above depends on the will to stand firm for
freedom. To make sure our community has this will, we need to
spread the idea to the new users as they come into the
community.
</p>

<p>
But we are failing to do so: the efforts to attract new users
into our community are far outstripping the efforts to teach
them the civics of our community. We need to do both, and we
need to keep the two efforts in balance.
</p>

This post is just to keep up a promise that I made to a friend of
mine (well, actually myself).  Presently, its the placement heat
in our campus and people are busy writing tests, waiting, giving
interviews and partying. This post doesn't have much to with all
that though.  In one of the interviews, I was called back and
asked about my Cleft Lip and Palate<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="/posts/the-third-round.html#fn.1">1</a></sup>. The interview panel had
concerns if I faced any serious medical problems due to this. I
explained to them everything that I knew about it and they were
convinced.
</p>

<p>
Later, I realized, I never explicitly did any reading on this
issue or asked my parents/others about this. I somehow knew about
it always. I probably learnt at all those visits to the dentist or
may be sub-consciously, when I was a baby. It isn't, though,
surprising to me that those guys had some reservations about
it. It's not everyday that you see a guy with a Cleft, though
statistics say there's prevalence of 1 in 500 births
world-wide. As a matter of fact, I myself haven't seen another guy
all my life (except for the pictures at my dentists') (also, they
weren't too wrong in suspecting other problems, though they had
absolutely no clue about this medical condition)
</p>

<p>
If you are wondering what the point of this post is, it's
nothing. It's just a pointer to those interested in reading
further on Cleft Lip and Palate.
