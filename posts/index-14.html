The idea is simple: we’ve prepared a dataset with all the questions on Stack Overflow, including everything we knew about them right before they were posted, and whether they finally ended up closed or not.  You grab the data, build your brilliant classifier, run it against some leaderboard data and submit your results.  Rinse and repeat until the contest ends, when we’ll grab the most promising classifiers and run them against fresh data to choose winners.

One of the things with git that you can mess-up, if you are not
used to, is git diff.  A friend of mine was trying to add a couple
of new files, and changes to existing files.  But, he was on the
wrong branch, and wanted to change to a different branch, before
committing.  Being new to git, he wanted to take a patch.  Reset
the changes, apply the patch back.
</p>

<p>
This is what he did
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>git add new_file.txt
git add old_file1.txt old_file2.txt <span class="c"># don't add old_file3.txt</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Oh, damn, I want to change the branch.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>git diff &gt; a.patch
git reset --hard
git checkout other-branch
</pre></div>

<p>
Let me commit my changes…
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>git apply a.patch
git commit -m
git show
</pre></div>

<p>
Oh crap!  Where are my new files?  They aren't commited!  Lemme
add them.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>ls new_file.txt
ls: cannot access new_file.txt: No such file or directory
</pre></div>

<p>
Dammit!  Where are my changes gone?
</p>

<p>
The problem was with <code>git diff</code>.  It gives only the only the
un-staged changes.  <code>--cached</code> option has to specified, to get the
staged changes in the diff output.  <code>git diff HEAD</code> shows diff
output with both staged and un-staged changes.
</p>

<p>
But the whole workflow above is a beginners workflow.  A user
comfortable with git would've committed and then moved the commit
around using cherry-pick or the like.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>git add &lt;all-files&gt;
git commit -m <span class="s2">"My awesome changes."</span>  <span class="c">#committed on branch1</span>
git checkout other-branch
git cherry-pick branch1

Pankaj and I were stuck with this weird bug recently.  We had
a class <code>A</code> and a subclass <code>B</code> and an instance of B, b, was
returning False for <code>isinstance(b, A)</code>.
</p>

<p>
After some debugging, we found that it was a problem with
imports, and the same module was being imported twice, using
two different names – <code>bar</code> and <code>baz.bar</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here's a cooked-up example to demonstrate the "bug".  We
create a package baz, as shown below.
</p>


<pre class="example">
$ tree baz
baz
├── bar.py
├── foo.py
└── __init__.py
</pre>

<p>
We have our two classes, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> defined in the <code>bar</code>
module.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">A</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">B</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
We run <code>foo.py</code> and scratch our heads for a while, before
figuring out what's wrong…
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># We add the directory containing out package 'baz' to sys.path to be</span>
<span class="c"># able to import using the package name.</span>

He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. "After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain."

The substance of the issue probably doesn't matter much. There is
no real confidentiality of medical records in the US, since the
police can get them under very easy conditions. Nonetheless, it is
a dishonest proceeding, systematically asking patients to accept
policies they have not seen and then make false statements.

In writing. Don't use adjectives which merely tell us how you want
us to feel about the thing you are describing. I mean, instead of
telling us a thing was "terrible," describe it so that we'll be
terrified. Don't say it was "delightful"; make us say "delightful"
when we've read the description. You see, all those words
(horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying
to your readers, "Please will you do my job for me."

A few days back, a couple of friends and I were discussing, how
anything sells in India and how opening a restaurant is seemingly
an easy way to make some quick bucks.  But, now, I have a much
better plan to make some big money, may be not so quickly, but
definitely a lot more – at least by an order of magnitude.
</p>

<p>
Religion!  Nothing sells like it, in the land of snake charmers!
People will buy anything on offer.  This post gives the recipe for
turning a small temple in a <span class="underline">god forsaken</span> town, into a big place
of worship that "attracts" devotees from all over the country, if
not the world!
</p>

<p>
The first task would be to zero-in on a temple.  But before that,
let's define the kind of town we are interested in.  Ideally, the
town should be within a couple of hundred kilometers away from a
city with good transport connectivity and a population at around
one and a half million (There are about 20 such cities, in the
country).  The temple in question could piggy back on the fame of
a temple nearby, if it is within about 50 kilometers of a really
famous temple, but in that case, our temple would remain the
second preference, for a very long time to come.  But this is much
easier to accomplish and arguably a quicker buck.  Ideally,
though, we'd prefer a location, which doesn't have any other
famous temples in the radius of about 300 kms (roughly 5-6 hours
by road).  It also helps if the travel to the temple for the big
city is through the country side, giving a glimpse of the country
side that urban Indians can only dream of connecting, the life
that was once lived by their parents and grandparents, but they
now only get to see in the movies.  This will help us score some
points with the "educated and sophisticated" urban populace.
</p>

<p>
Now, the temple.  It should be the biggest or the only one in
town, though having smaller temples around helps in knitting more
tales around the temple.  The temple in question should be one,
that the locals have tremendous faith in.  You should be able to
find at least a dozen people who vouch for the miraculous power of
the gods in there, without trying too hard.  That should be good
enough, to get you going, and I believe this isn't too hard for
any random temple, anywhere in the country.
</p>

<p>
The gods.  It really doesn't matter who the god is.  He/she could
either be a generalist or a specialist and that would influence
the type of crowds coming in.  Your god can be as specialized as
you like, up to the extent of specializing in blessing people get
visas to the US.  Now, your god can either be an already well
known god, or a not so well known incarnation of a well known god,
or a new person who is soon to become god!  The first type is a
hard bet; the third option is somewhat high risk too, and you'll
really need to put your mind to it, to make it work.  The second
option is the easiest one.  It always helps to have some real
objects and places that can be associated with the god, and are
living proof that the god once lived here and used those things.
It really helps if you can give the devotees the feeling that they
are doing all the things that the god in question once used to do,
at the same places he/she used to do it.  Type-3 gods would work
well for this.
</p>

<p>
Spread the word.  This, obviously, is the most important part and
the hardest one too.  It's best to start with the word of mouth.
Start with family and friends and friends of friends and friends
of friends of friends (read as facebook-only-friends).  Pick the
more religious of the lot, encourage them to visit the place,
write and share blog posts/tweets/pictures/tales/stories and
whatever else, with them.  Encourage them to interact with the
locals.  I don't think it would be necessary to make any deals
with the locals.  They are smart enough, wherever you go!  You
need to actively market your god, until a critical mass of happy
devotees, has been reached.  A critical mass is reached, when
there are more people talking of their wishes coming true, than
there are people who are still waiting for their wishes to come
true.  This should be too hard given that, religious people tend
to believe that whatever happens, happens for the best and god has
better plans for them, than their own.  Slowly, you could coax one
of the better writers (who is also religious?) into writing a book
or two about your temple.  A couple of years after selling your
book, you should try and encourage one of the big TV houses to
make a teleserial based on the book, and that would be it!  Now,
you can sit back and relax.
</p>

<p>
While getting all of the above right is important, it is also
super important to work out things with the current priest, form a
temple trust, and manage other such things and to time all of it
perfectly.  This part of the plan is left as an exercise for the
reader.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, this is a much more fruitful exercise than setting
up a restaurant, since this helps a whole economy grow around the
temple.  A whole bunch of things crop up, near our small town.
Transportation grows by leaps and bounds, hospitals and schools
grow with the population, the local vendors start earning more and
get a better quality of life, and all that jazz.  I guess, you get
the drift.
