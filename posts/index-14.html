I really liked this song, गुस्ताख दिल (Gustaakh dil) from the movie
English Vinglish.  Lyrics by Swanand Kirkire are deep and
meaningful as usual!

I was looking for the lyrics on the web, and none of the sites
seemed to have got it totally right.  Shantanu and I listened to
it a bunch of times and think we have got it all right, here.

Dear owner-of-a-random-web-startup,
</p>

<p>
Thank you for starting your brand new, awesome web service.  But,
please don't expect me to use it, if you ask me to have a password
with atleast one upper-case letter, one numeral, one symbol and
one unicode hindi character and 20 hebrew characters.  Is it
really so essential to enforce such complicated rules on my
passwords, making it difficult for me to remember what password I
used?  Isn't OAuth and OpenID so much easier to use?  If you
really want to enforce such complex rules on my password, at least
show the arbitrary rules you enforce on me, at the login prompt too!
</p>

<p>
Sincerely,
A frustrated-web-monkey

PyCon is back to Bangalore for the 4th edition.  I've been to all
the previous three editions, and I'm looking forward to this one.
</p>

<p>
I haven't spoken at any of the previous editions, and hadn't
even really considered speaking at the previous editions.
But, this time, I proposed a couple of talks, and both of them
have been accepted! Woot! Lots of work ahead of me, but I'm
really looking forward to give good talks.  I'll be talking
about Enaml, and showing a brief demo of all the wonderful
things it makes possible.  In the other talk, I'll give a
brief overview of the latest happenings in the SciPy community
and the projects to look forward to and contribute to.  Pankaj
and I will be talking together on this.
</p>


<p>
Also, Kenneth (lawgon) will be deeply missed at this edition
of PyCon.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, John Hunter, the lead author of matplotlib, also passed
away last week.  RIP. :(

I bought a new bike, about a month ago, and today was the first
longish ride on it.  Well, longish compared to my ~1.5km rides to
the office.
</p>

<p>
At 19:45, I just set out to get some fresh air.  After sitting for
two days, inside the house, by the evening on Sunday, I tend to
get stuffy.  I started riding westward and the fresh air got to my
head, I ended up pedaling too far away to get back, without going
to the beach.  It was fun, having adrenaline pumping all over.
But, there was much more traffic than I would've liked.  Anyway,
one shower on the way up, and one puncture on the way back
(thankfully, close enough to my house), it was a fun ride on the
whole.
</p>

<p>
I didn't time myself, but I roughly covered about 25 kms in say
about ~2 hours.  Hoping to start riding more frequently and going
on longer rides.

One of the things with git that you can mess-up, if you are not
used to, is git diff.  A friend of mine was trying to add a couple
of new files, and changes to existing files.  But, he was on the
wrong branch, and wanted to change to a different branch, before
committing.  Being new to git, he wanted to take a patch.  Reset
the changes, apply the patch back.
</p>

<p>
This is what he did
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>git add new_file.txt
git add old_file1.txt old_file2.txt <span class="c"># don't add old_file3.txt</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Oh, damn, I want to change the branch.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>git diff &gt; a.patch
git reset --hard
git checkout other-branch
</pre></div>

<p>
Let me commit my changes…
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>git apply a.patch
git commit -m
git show
</pre></div>

<p>
Oh crap!  Where are my new files?  They aren't commited!  Lemme
add them.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>ls new_file.txt
ls: cannot access new_file.txt: No such file or directory
</pre></div>

<p>
Dammit!  Where are my changes gone?
</p>

<p>
The problem was with <code>git diff</code>.  It gives only the only the
un-staged changes.  <code>--cached</code> option has to specified, to get the
staged changes in the diff output.  <code>git diff HEAD</code> shows diff
output with both staged and un-staged changes.
</p>

<p>
But the whole workflow above is a beginners workflow.  A user
comfortable with git would've committed and then moved the commit
around using cherry-pick or the like.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>git add &lt;all-files&gt;
git commit -m <span class="s2">"My awesome changes."</span>  <span class="c">#committed on branch1</span>
git checkout other-branch
git cherry-pick branch1

Pankaj and I were stuck with this weird bug recently.  We had
a class <code>A</code> and a subclass <code>B</code> and an instance of B, b, was
returning False for <code>isinstance(b, A)</code>.
</p>

<p>
After some debugging, we found that it was a problem with
imports, and the same module was being imported twice, using
two different names – <code>bar</code> and <code>baz.bar</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here's a cooked-up example to demonstrate the "bug".  We
create a package baz, as shown below.
</p>


<pre class="example">
$ tree baz
baz
├── bar.py
├── foo.py
└── __init__.py
</pre>

<p>
We have our two classes, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> defined in the <code>bar</code>
module.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">A</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
We run <code>foo.py</code> and scratch our heads for a while, before
figuring out what's wrong…
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># We add the directory containing out package 'baz' to sys.path to be</span>
<span class="c"># able to import using the package name.</span>

<p>
A few days back, a couple of friends and I were discussing, how
anything sells in India and how opening a restaurant is seemingly
an easy way to make some quick bucks.  But, now, I have a much
better plan to make some big money, may be not so quickly, but
definitely a lot more – at least by an order of magnitude.
</p>

<p>
Religion!  Nothing sells like it, in the land of snake charmers!
People will buy anything on offer.  This post gives the recipe for
turning a small temple in a <span class="underline">god forsaken</span> town, into a big place
of worship that "attracts" devotees from all over the country, if
not the world!
</p>

<p>
The first task would be to zero-in on a temple.  But before that,
let's define the kind of town we are interested in.  Ideally, the
town should be within a couple of hundred kilometers away from a
city with good transport connectivity and a population at around
one and a half million (There are about 20 such cities, in the
country).  The temple in question could piggy back on the fame of
a temple nearby, if it is within about 50 kilometers of a really
famous temple, but in that case, our temple would remain the
second preference, for a very long time to come.  But this is much
easier to accomplish and arguably a quicker buck.  Ideally,
though, we'd prefer a location, which doesn't have any other
famous temples in the radius of about 300 kms (roughly 5-6 hours
by road).  It also helps if the travel to the temple for the big
city is through the country side, giving a glimpse of the country
side that urban Indians can only dream of connecting, the life
that was once lived by their parents and grandparents, but they
now only get to see in the movies.  This will help us score some
points with the "educated and sophisticated" urban populace.
</p>

<p>
Now, the temple.  It should be the biggest or the only one in
town, though having smaller temples around helps in knitting more
tales around the temple.  The temple in question should be one,
that the locals have tremendous faith in.  You should be able to
find at least a dozen people who vouch for the miraculous power of
the gods in there, without trying too hard.  That should be good
enough, to get you going, and I believe this isn't too hard for
any random temple, anywhere in the country.
</p>

<p>
The gods.  It really doesn't matter who the god is.  He/she could
either be a generalist or a specialist and that would influence
the type of crowds coming in.  Your god can be as specialized as
you like, up to the extent of specializing in blessing people get
visas to the US.  Now, your god can either be an already well
known god, or a not so well known incarnation of a well known god,
or a new person who is soon to become god!  The first type is a
hard bet; the third option is somewhat high risk too, and you'll
really need to put your mind to it, to make it work.  The second
option is the easiest one.  It always helps to have some real
objects and places that can be associated with the god, and are
living proof that the god once lived here and used those things.
It really helps if you can give the devotees the feeling that they
are doing all the things that the god in question once used to do,
at the same places he/she used to do it.  Type-3 gods would work
well for this.
</p>

<p>
Spread the word.  This, obviously, is the most important part and
the hardest one too.  It's best to start with the word of mouth.
Start with family and friends and friends of friends and friends
of friends of friends (read as facebook-only-friends).  Pick the
more religious of the lot, encourage them to visit the place,
write and share blog posts/tweets/pictures/tales/stories and
whatever else, with them.  Encourage them to interact with the
locals.  I don't think it would be necessary to make any deals
with the locals.  They are smart enough, wherever you go!  You
need to actively market your god, until a critical mass of happy
devotees, has been reached.  A critical mass is reached, when
there are more people talking of their wishes coming true, than
there are people who are still waiting for their wishes to come
true.  This should be too hard given that, religious people tend
to believe that whatever happens, happens for the best and god has
better plans for them, than their own.  Slowly, you could coax one
of the better writers (who is also religious?) into writing a book
or two about your temple.  A couple of years after selling your
book, you should try and encourage one of the big TV houses to
make a teleserial based on the book, and that would be it!  Now,
you can sit back and relax.
</p>

<p>
While getting all of the above right is important, it is also
super important to work out things with the current priest, form a
temple trust, and manage other such things and to time all of it
perfectly.  This part of the plan is left as an exercise for the
reader.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, this is a much more fruitful exercise than setting
up a restaurant, since this helps a whole economy grow around the
temple.  A whole bunch of things crop up, near our small town.
Transportation grows by leaps and bounds, hospitals and schools
grow with the population, the local vendors start earning more and
get a better quality of life, and all that jazz.  I guess, you get
the drift.

If you aren't already aware of it, I'm one of those people who
goes around saying, "GitHub is my Facebook".  I spend quite a lot
of time on GitHub, browsing the work of various people, looking at
loads of interesting stuff that people built.  I keep jumping
between people pages and projects using the Watchers/Watching &amp;
Followers/Following pages.  This way, I do come across interesting
people and projects, but the SNR is too low.  I wanted a better
way to be able to see stuff, that I find interesting.  That's how
the idea for this Chromium app – GitHub Cue – was born.
</p>

<p>
@baali and I hacked on this, during the last few days and got it
working.  It works as follows, (from the README) —
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Scrapes all the descriptions of the repositories being watched
by the user.
</li>
<li>Key terms are extracted from this description text using the
Yahoo Term Extractor.
</li>
<li>A list of languages is obtained, based on the languages of the
repositories, the user if watching.
</li>
<li>GitHub searches are performed for a combination of 3 randomly
chosen languages and 5 random key terms.
</li>
<li>10 random repositories out of all these, are shown.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
This is a very simplistic algorithm, but works decently for my
purposes.  Ideally, I would've liked to use a Collaborative
Filtering algorithm, but I found the data to be too sparse, and
the amount of computation to be too much to be done on the fly.  I
wasn't really interested in pre-computing stuff and putting it
onto my server.  I settled down to the next best thing I could
think of.
</p>

<p>
I would appreciate any further ideas and suggestions.  Thanks!

Well, I'm not sure if it's worth writing about.  I conducted my
first org-mode workshop along with Prof. Venkatesh Choppella at
IIIT-Hyderabad.  It was a 3 hour demo+talk kind of a thing, with a
small audience of about 20 people, most of whom were new to
Emacs.
</p>

<p>
We covered almost all the aspects of Org-mode after giving a brief
introduction to Emacs.  Outlining and note-taking part was simple
and easy to understand, but the audience couldn't really
appreciate the part of keeping TODO lists and agendas and other
stuff.  I'm hoping, the reason was not me taking over from
Venkatesh.
</p>

<p>
I think the workshop should've been more hands-on and we should've
asked people to try out stuff on the spot, instead of showing off
the things possible with Emacs.  They probably would've
appreciated a few things better, that way.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, we will be doing more workshops on Org-mode and there
are surely somethings to take away from this one.  I hope at least
one of the participants, gets hooked to Org-mode.
</p>

<p>
The talk outline is here.

    <p class="verse">
the time, together spent,<br>
the memories cherished,<br>
all the love, concern and care<br>
may they stay with us, for life.<br>
<br>
as high and far as you like<br>
may you fly, like you own the sky<br>
while I fumble, with my flying guide<br>
I see the world, through your eyes<br>
<br>
may you run, with all your might<br>
as if, fighting for life, you are.<br>
struggling to walk, I stumble and fall,<br>
but get up each time, inspired to run.<br>
<br>
may you, in all that we shared<br>
find strength to go on, if en-route<br>
our paths diverged; you may have to wait,<br>
but you shall see me, on the other side!<br>

Thanks to Chaitu, I re-read Love Unvoiced a few times and
realized, I was trying to say too much. Here's another poem,
with one part of what I wanted to say. I will not be writing
newer poems, to say the other stuff. Perform your own Fourier
analysis.
