  So if you donate those football tickets to some fans who were
  willing to sit out in the snow for hours, you’d feel better about
  staying in bed and watching the game on television.

  Born of human error, continually generating copious heat, the
  Elephant’s Foot is still melting into the base of the Chernobyl
  nuclear power plant. If it hits ground water, it could trigger
  another catastrophic explosion or leech radioactive material into
  the water nearby residents drink. Long after bleeding from the core,
  this unique piece of waste continues to be a testament to the
  potential dangers of nuclear power. The Elephant’s Foot will be
  there for centuries, sitting in the dark basement of a concrete and
  steel sarcophagus, a symbol of one of humankind’s most powerful
  tools gone awry.

  I told you before that the purpose of mathematics is insight, but I
  think I lied. Even more than that, the reason I do math is the
  excitement and uncertainty of the chase. There is no joy in applying
  a computer algorithm, but there is joy in unlocking the delicate
  clockwork mechanism that makes a good math problem tick. And, in the
  end, you just might learn something that nobody else in the world
  knows!

  … Oh, and by the way, I really don’t believe that honesty is merely
  a wasted opportunity to cheat. I said that just for effect. Honest.
