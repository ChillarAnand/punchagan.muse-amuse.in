  Learning to code is merely teaching people to spell.

  Computer Science is about what makes a poem beautiful, why
  alliteration is alluring, how iambic pentameter unlocks the secrets
  of Shakespeare.

  how do you determine a need that isn't being fulfilled and might be
  the basis for a project/business? Two ways. You could ask people
  what problems they have that you might be able to help solve, or
  (for introverts like me) examine what processes or services feel
  needlessly difficult in your own life.

  Dewey-Hagborg’s work is super interesting, not to mention searingly
  contemporary. “It’s a very accessible way for the public to engage
  with this new technology. It really brings to light how powerful it
  is, the idea that a hair from your head can fall on your street and
  a perfect stranger can pick it up and know something about it,” she
  says, adding: “With DNA sequencing becoming faster and cheaper, this
  is the world we’re all going to be living in.”

  Standing up all day can be tough at first, but I'm much happier
  working like that. Plus, when you finally switch off at night,
  you'll feel like you've done more than just think and type.

  If the counter is displayed during the meeting, then everyone can
  decide whether or not the meeting is generating a sensible
  return. Whoever has the courage to call off a meeting on the grounds
  it probably isn't worth it should get 10% of the expected meeting
  costs saved to spend on a project of their choice (no meetings
  allowed ;-).

  In short, it's easy to burnout. Do these 5 things, and you can
  burnout too.
