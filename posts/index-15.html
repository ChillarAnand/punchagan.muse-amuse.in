In writing. Don't use adjectives which merely tell us how you want
us to feel about the thing you are describing. I mean, instead of
telling us a thing was "terrible," describe it so that we'll be
terrified. Don't say it was "delightful"; make us say "delightful"
when we've read the description. You see, all those words
(horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying
to your readers, "Please will you do my job for me."

A few days back, a couple of friends and I were discussing, how
anything sells in India and how opening a restaurant is seemingly
an easy way to make some quick bucks.  But, now, I have a much
better plan to make some big money, may be not so quickly, but
definitely a lot more – at least by an order of magnitude.
</p>

<p>
Religion!  Nothing sells like it, in the land of snake charmers!
People will buy anything on offer.  This post gives the recipe for
turning a small temple in a <span class="underline">god forsaken</span> town, into a big place
of worship that "attracts" devotees from all over the country, if
not the world!
</p>

<p>
The first task would be to zero-in on a temple.  But before that,
let's define the kind of town we are interested in.  Ideally, the
town should be within a couple of hundred kilometers away from a
city with good transport connectivity and a population at around
one and a half million (There are about 20 such cities, in the
country).  The temple in question could piggy back on the fame of
a temple nearby, if it is within about 50 kilometers of a really
famous temple, but in that case, our temple would remain the
second preference, for a very long time to come.  But this is much
easier to accomplish and arguably a quicker buck.  Ideally,
though, we'd prefer a location, which doesn't have any other
famous temples in the radius of about 300 kms (roughly 5-6 hours
by road).  It also helps if the travel to the temple for the big
city is through the country side, giving a glimpse of the country
side that urban Indians can only dream of connecting, the life
that was once lived by their parents and grandparents, but they
now only get to see in the movies.  This will help us score some
points with the "educated and sophisticated" urban populace.
</p>

<p>
Now, the temple.  It should be the biggest or the only one in
town, though having smaller temples around helps in knitting more
tales around the temple.  The temple in question should be one,
that the locals have tremendous faith in.  You should be able to
find at least a dozen people who vouch for the miraculous power of
the gods in there, without trying too hard.  That should be good
enough, to get you going, and I believe this isn't too hard for
any random temple, anywhere in the country.
</p>

<p>
The gods.  It really doesn't matter who the god is.  He/she could
either be a generalist or a specialist and that would influence
the type of crowds coming in.  Your god can be as specialized as
you like, up to the extent of specializing in blessing people get
visas to the US.  Now, your god can either be an already well
known god, or a not so well known incarnation of a well known god,
or a new person who is soon to become god!  The first type is a
hard bet; the third option is somewhat high risk too, and you'll
really need to put your mind to it, to make it work.  The second
option is the easiest one.  It always helps to have some real
objects and places that can be associated with the god, and are
living proof that the god once lived here and used those things.
It really helps if you can give the devotees the feeling that they
are doing all the things that the god in question once used to do,
at the same places he/she used to do it.  Type-3 gods would work
well for this.
</p>

<p>
Spread the word.  This, obviously, is the most important part and
the hardest one too.  It's best to start with the word of mouth.
Start with family and friends and friends of friends and friends
of friends of friends (read as facebook-only-friends).  Pick the
more religious of the lot, encourage them to visit the place,
write and share blog posts/tweets/pictures/tales/stories and
whatever else, with them.  Encourage them to interact with the
locals.  I don't think it would be necessary to make any deals
with the locals.  They are smart enough, wherever you go!  You
need to actively market your god, until a critical mass of happy
devotees, has been reached.  A critical mass is reached, when
there are more people talking of their wishes coming true, than
there are people who are still waiting for their wishes to come
true.  This should be too hard given that, religious people tend
to believe that whatever happens, happens for the best and god has
better plans for them, than their own.  Slowly, you could coax one
of the better writers (who is also religious?) into writing a book
or two about your temple.  A couple of years after selling your
book, you should try and encourage one of the big TV houses to
make a teleserial based on the book, and that would be it!  Now,
you can sit back and relax.
</p>

<p>
While getting all of the above right is important, it is also
super important to work out things with the current priest, form a
temple trust, and manage other such things and to time all of it
perfectly.  This part of the plan is left as an exercise for the
reader.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, this is a much more fruitful exercise than setting
up a restaurant, since this helps a whole economy grow around the
temple.  A whole bunch of things crop up, near our small town.
Transportation grows by leaps and bounds, hospitals and schools
grow with the population, the local vendors start earning more and
get a better quality of life, and all that jazz.  I guess, you get
the drift.

When will you learn to attack a system in order to alter its agenda? When will your protest be proof of your pent-up anger? Will you come up with an activism that cannot be appropriated? No other country awaits a revolution as eagerly as ours, no other country needs one as desperately either. This revolution is not somebody else’s business. Where is your characteristic killing rage? Where is mine, for that matter?

If you aren't already aware of it, I'm one of those people who
goes around saying, "GitHub is my Facebook".  I spend quite a lot
of time on GitHub, browsing the work of various people, looking at
loads of interesting stuff that people built.  I keep jumping
between people pages and projects using the Watchers/Watching &amp;
Followers/Following pages.  This way, I do come across interesting
people and projects, but the SNR is too low.  I wanted a better
way to be able to see stuff, that I find interesting.  That's how
the idea for this Chromium app – GitHub Cue – was born.
</p>

<p>
@baali and I hacked on this, during the last few days and got it
working.  It works as follows, (from the README) —
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Scrapes all the descriptions of the repositories being watched
by the user.
</li>
<li>Key terms are extracted from this description text using the
Yahoo Term Extractor.
</li>
<li>A list of languages is obtained, based on the languages of the
repositories, the user if watching.
</li>
<li>GitHub searches are performed for a combination of 3 randomly
chosen languages and 5 random key terms.
</li>
<li>10 random repositories out of all these, are shown.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is a very simplistic algorithm, but works decently for my
purposes.  Ideally, I would've liked to use a Collaborative
Filtering algorithm, but I found the data to be too sparse, and
the amount of computation to be too much to be done on the fly.  I
wasn't really interested in pre-computing stuff and putting it
