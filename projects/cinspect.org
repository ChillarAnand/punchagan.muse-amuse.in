~cinspect~ attempts to extend Python's built-in inspect module to add
"inspection" for Python's builtins and other objects not written in Python.  It
uses ~libclang~ to parse C-code and indexes it to allow looking up the source
of the required objects.

The original idea was from a friend, [[https://twitter.com/ballingt/statuses/483394809411825665][Tom Ballinger]], who also helped me design
and test it out.
