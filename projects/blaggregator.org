Recursers write awesome blog posts all over the internet, and ~blaggregator~ is
a Django powered site that aggregates all these posts. (You will need an RC
login to view it).

The project was originally thought of, and built by [[https://github.com/sursh][Sasha]].  I've added a bunch
of features to it, and help with maintaining it.
