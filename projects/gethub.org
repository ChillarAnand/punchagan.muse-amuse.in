GetHub was made for the geeks whose primary Social Network is GitHub and who
keep checking for updates, a dozen times every hour. :)

This extension was written when pop-up notifications were newly introduced into
Chrome, and I was excited by it.  I now prefer a workspace with fewer
distractions, and no longer use this.
